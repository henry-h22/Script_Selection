( shhssh_00002 "Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore." )
( shhssh_00003 "For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands." )
( shhssh_00004 "Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil." )
( shhssh_00005 "Will we ever forget it." )
( shhssh_00006 "God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever." )
( shhssh_00007 "And you always want to see it in the superlative degree." )
( shhssh_00008 "Gad, your letter came just in time." )
( shhssh_00009 "He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table." )
( shhssh_00010 "I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game." )
( shhssh_00011 "If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now." )
( shhssh_00012 "Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet." )
( shhssh_00013 "He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique." )
( shhssh_00014 "Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed." )
( shhssh_00015 "It's the aurora borealis." )
( shhssh_00016 "There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep." )
( shhssh_00017 "From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy." )
( shhssh_00018 "There was a change now." )
( shhssh_00019 "I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances." )
( shhssh_00020 "Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories." )
( shhssh_00021 "It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it." )
( shhssh_00022 "Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition." )
( shhssh_00023 "A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges." )
( shhssh_00024 "It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy." )
( shhssh_00025 "I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed." )
( shhssh_00026 "It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting." )
( shhssh_00027 "To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor." )
( shhssh_00028 "Robbery, bribery, fraud, " )
( shhssh_00029 "Their forces were already moving into the north country." )
( shhssh_00030 "I had faith in them." )
( shhssh_00031 "They were three hundred yards apart." )
( shhssh_00032 "Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step." )
( shhssh_00033 "He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson." )
( shhssh_00034 "Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children." )
( shhssh_00035 "He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes." )
( shhssh_00036 "She turned in at the hotel." )
( shhssh_00037 "I was the only one who remained sitting." )
( shhssh_00038 "We'll have to watch our chances." )
( shhssh_00039 "The ship should be in within a week or ten days." )
( shhssh_00040 "I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here." )
( shhssh_00041 "Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell." )
( shhssh_00042 "How could he explain his possession of the sketch." )
( shhssh_00043 "It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson." )
( shhssh_00044 "Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip." )
( shhssh_00045 "He moved away as quietly as he had come." )
( shhssh_00046 "The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear." )
( shhssh_00047 "Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog." )
( shhssh_00048 "He looked at the handkerchief more, closely." )
( shhssh_00049 "Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin." )
( shhssh_00050 "In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously." )
( shhssh_00051 "The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow." )
( shhssh_00052 "It was a curious coincidence." )
( shhssh_00053 "Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief." )
( shhssh_00054 "There was nothing on the rock." )
( shhssh_00055 "Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound." )
( shhssh_00056 "Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly." )
( shhssh_00057 "I have no idea, replied Philip." )
( shhssh_00058 "I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else." )
( shhssh_00059 "His immaculate appearance was gone." )
( shhssh_00060 "Anyway, no one saw her like that." )
( shhssh_00061 "Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him." )
( shhssh_00062 "The men stared into each other's face." )
( shhssh_00063 "Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger." )
( shhssh_00064 "The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments." )
( shhssh_00065 "They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel." )
( shhssh_00066 "He saw Jeanne falter for a moment." )
( shhssh_00067 "Surely I will excuse you, she cried." )
( shhssh_00068 "In a flash Philip followed its direction." )
( shhssh_00069 "It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father." )
( shhssh_00070 "He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there." )
( shhssh_00071 "What was the object of your little sensation." )
( shhssh_00072 "But who was Eileen's double." )
( shhssh_00073 "The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them." )
( shhssh_00074 "And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him." )
( shhssh_00075 "There has been a change, she interrupted him." )
( shhssh_00076 "The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened." )
( shhssh_00077 "It is the fire, partly, she said." )
( shhssh_00078 "Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her." )
( shhssh_00079 "It was a large canoe." )
( shhssh_00080 "What if Jeanne failed him." )
( shhssh_00081 "What if she did not come to the rock." )
( shhssh_00082 "His face was streaming with blood." )
( shhssh_00083 "A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes." )
( shhssh_00084 "Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open." )
( shhssh_00085 "A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face." )
( shhssh_00086 "Death had come with terrible suddenness." )
( shhssh_00087 "Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man." )
( shhssh_00088 "He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling." )
( shhssh_00089 "The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by." )
( shhssh_00090 "The singing voice approached rapidly." )
( shhssh_00091 "His blood grew hot with rage at the thought." )
( shhssh_00092 "He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores." )
( shhssh_00093 "For a full minute he crouched and listened." )
( shhssh_00094 "He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire." )
( shhssh_00095 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision." )
( shhssh_00096 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest." )
( shhssh_00097 "Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow." )
( shhssh_00098 "Shall I carry you." )
( shhssh_00099 "A maddening joy pounded in his brain." )
( shhssh_00100 "You must sleep, he urged." )
( shhssh_00101 "You, you would not keep the truth from me." )
( shhssh_00102 "He will follow us soon." )
( shhssh_00103 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe." )
( shhssh_00104 "She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child." )
( shhssh_00105 "Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe." )
( shhssh_00106 "The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob." )
( shhssh_00107 "If you only could know how I thank you." )
( shhssh_00108 "He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself." )
( shhssh_00109 "Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you." )
( shhssh_00110 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely." )
( shhssh_00111 "Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children." )
( shhssh_00112 "He was wounded in the arm." )
( shhssh_00113 "I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians." )
( shhssh_00114 "Her words sent a strange chill through Philip." )
( shhssh_00115 "He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him." )
( shhssh_00116 "Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin." )
( shhssh_00117 "She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice." )
( shhssh_00118 "Pierre obeys me when we are together." )
( shhssh_00119 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward." )
( shhssh_00120 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante." )
( shhssh_00121 "They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours." )
( shhssh_00122 "Two years ago I gave up civilization for this." )
( shhssh_00123 "She had died from cold and starvation." )
( shhssh_00124 "It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks." )
( shhssh_00125 "He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself." )
( shhssh_00126 "Each day she became a more vital part of him." )
( shhssh_00127 "It was a temptation, but he resisted it." )
( shhssh_00128 "This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born." )
( shhssh_00129 "Her face was against his breast." )
( shhssh_00130 "She was his now, forever." )
( shhssh_00131 "Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom." )
( shhssh_00132 "A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips." )
( shhssh_00133 "Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength." )
( shhssh_00134 "He obeyed the pressure of her hand." )
( shhssh_00135 "I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre." )
( shhssh_00136 "About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age." )
( shhssh_00137 "Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure." )
( shhssh_00138 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne." )
( shhssh_00139 "He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes." )
( shhssh_00140 "Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this." )
( shhssh_00141 "It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God." )
( shhssh_00142 "Such things had occurred before, he told Philip." )
( shhssh_00143 "Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed." )
( shhssh_00144 "But there was something even more startling than this resemblance." )
( shhssh_00145 "I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily." )
( shhssh_00146 "Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued." )
( shhssh_00147 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness." )
( shhssh_00148 "Now these things had been struck dead within him." )
( shhssh_00149 "For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky." )
( shhssh_00150 "Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted." )
( shhssh_00151 "And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare." )
( shhssh_00152 "Philip thrust himself against it and entered." )
( shhssh_00153 "MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger." )
( shhssh_00154 "He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black." )
( shhssh_00155 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen." )
( shhssh_00156 "A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned." )
( shhssh_00157 "He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice." )
( shhssh_00158 "Does that look good." )
( shhssh_00159 "They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life." )
( shhssh_00160 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt." )
( shhssh_00161 "Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub." )
( shhssh_00162 "That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe." )
( shhssh_00163 "Philip made no effort to follow." )
( shhssh_00164 "He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne." )
( shhssh_00165 "They are to attack your camp tomorrow night." )
( shhssh_00166 "Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding." )
( shhssh_00167 "I was near the cabin, and saw you." )
( shhssh_00168 "Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting." )
( shhssh_00169 "Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant." )
( shhssh_00170 "There was none of the joy of meeting in his face." )
( shhssh_00171 "And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen." )
( shhssh_00172 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar." )
( shhssh_00173 "The date was nearly eighteen years old." )
( shhssh_00174 "They were the presage of storm." )
( shhssh_00175 "Down there the earth was already swelling with life." )
( shhssh_00176 "For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap." )
( shhssh_00177 "She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled." )
( shhssh_00178 "Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated." )
( shhssh_00179 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said." )
( shhssh_00180 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed." )
( shhssh_00181 "So cheer up, and give us your paw." )
( shhssh_00182 "This time he did not yap for mercy." )
( shhssh_00183 "And the air was growing chilly." )
( shhssh_00184 "Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two." )
( shhssh_00185 "The questions may have come vaguely in his mind." )
( shhssh_00186 "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl." )
( shhssh_00187 "Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine." )
( shhssh_00188 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass." )
( shhssh_00189 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying." )
( shhssh_00190 "Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent." )
( shhssh_00191 "For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone." )
( shhssh_00192 "He did not rush in." )
( shhssh_00193 "It was edged with ice." )
( shhssh_00194 "He drank of the water cautiously." )
( shhssh_00195 "But a strange thing happened." )
( shhssh_00196 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog." )
( shhssh_00197 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose." )
( shhssh_00198 "Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions." )
( shhssh_00199 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day." )
( shhssh_00200 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more." )
( shhssh_00201 "He cried, and swung the club wildly." )
( shhssh_00202 "She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face." )
( shhssh_00203 "They were following the shore of a lake." )
( shhssh_00204 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him." )
( shhssh_00205 "From now on we're pals." )
( shhssh_00206 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau." )
( shhssh_00207 "How much was it." )
( shhssh_00208 "Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression." )
( shhssh_00209 "It was not a large lake, and almost round." )
( shhssh_00210 "Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards." )
( shhssh_00211 "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made." )
( shhssh_00212 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman." )
( shhssh_00213 "Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound." )
( shhssh_00214 "Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head." )
( shhssh_00215 "They die out of spite." )
( shhssh_00216 "The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him." )
( shhssh_00217 "Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive." )
( shhssh_00218 "The ringing of the big bell aroused him." )
( shhssh_00219 "At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened." )
( shhssh_00220 "A dead man is of no use on a plantation." )
( shhssh_00221 "I don't know why you're here at all." )
( shhssh_00222 "What part of the United States is your home." )
( shhssh_00223 "My, I'm almost homesick for it already." )
( shhssh_00224 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist." )
( shhssh_00225 "I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up." )
( shhssh_00226 "That came before my A B C's." )
( shhssh_00227 "It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles." )
( shhssh_00228 "But it contributed to the smash." )
( shhssh_00229 "The last one I knew was an overseer." )
( shhssh_00230 "Do you know any good land around here." )
( shhssh_00231 "The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia." )
( shhssh_00232 "I cannot follow you, she said." )
( shhssh_00233 "I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me." )
( shhssh_00234 "Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil." )
( shhssh_00235 "His voice was passionately rebellious." )
( shhssh_00236 "Don't you see I hate you." )
( shhssh_00237 "So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves." )
( shhssh_00238 "It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon." )
( shhssh_00239 "He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter." )
( shhssh_00240 "Wash your hands of me." )
( shhssh_00241 "I think it's much nicer to quarrel." )
( shhssh_00242 "I saw it when she rolled." )
( shhssh_00243 "I only read the quotations." )
( shhssh_00244 "He was the soul of devotion to his employers." )
( shhssh_00245 "Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year." )
( shhssh_00246 "You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi." )
( shhssh_00247 "They ought to pass here some time today." )
( shhssh_00248 "I had been sad too long already." )
( shhssh_00249 "All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy." )
( shhssh_00250 "He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition." )
( shhssh_00251 "I may manage to freight a cargo back as well." )
( shhssh_00252 "O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals." )
( shhssh_00253 "He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino." )
( shhssh_00254 "Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller." )
( shhssh_00255 "You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that." )
( shhssh_00256 "See the length of the body and that elongated neck." )
( shhssh_00257 "They are coming ashore, whoever they are." )
( shhssh_00258 "Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays." )
( shhssh_00259 "Think of investing in such an adventure." )
( shhssh_00260 "Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all." )
( shhssh_00261 "I have been doubly baptized." )
( shhssh_00262 "They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha." )
( shhssh_00263 "Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed." )
( shhssh_00264 "And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young." )
( shhssh_00265 "The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment." )
( shhssh_00266 "They handled two men already, both grub-thieves." )
( shhssh_00267 "Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow." )
( shhssh_00268 "Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened." )
( shhssh_00269 "That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands." )
( shhssh_00270 "And after the bath a shave would not be bad." )
( shhssh_00271 "Now please give a plain statement of what occurred." )
( shhssh_00272 "You can take a vacation on pay." )
( shhssh_00273 "They are big trees and require plenty of room." )
( shhssh_00274 "And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house." )
( shhssh_00275 "There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them." )
( shhssh_00276 "Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference." )
( shhssh_00277 "McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin." )
( shhssh_00278 "It would give me nervous prostration." )
( shhssh_00279 "She said with chattering teeth." )
( shhssh_00280 "I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes." )
( shhssh_00281 "I do not blame you for anything; remember that." )
( shhssh_00282 "If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly." )
( shhssh_00283 "The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant." )
( shhssh_00284 "There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes." )
( shhssh_00285 "But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine." )
( shhssh_00286 "Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping." )
( shhssh_00287 "Keep an eye on him." )
( shhssh_00288 "Those are my oysters, he said at last." )
( shhssh_00289 "They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued." )
( shhssh_00290 "One by one the boys were captured." )
( shhssh_00291 "The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted." )
( shhssh_00292 "Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred." )
( shhssh_00293 "They were deep in the primeval forest." )
( shhssh_00294 "He had been foiled in his attempt to escape." )

( shhssh_00301 "But all my dreams violated this law." )
( shhssh_00302 "It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis." )

( shhssh_00099 "A good way to do that would be dynamic time warping" )
( shhssh_00100 "So just give everything a score of three" )

( shhssh_00110 "Once we have established those things, we'll  move on to thinking about exactly how to do that" )
( shhssh_00111 "For example, these all came contiguously" )
( shhssh_00112 "it just takes a moment to run because we're going through this big document" )
( shhssh_00113 "We might have the noise that's always going to make the task harder" )
( shhssh_00114 "It simply gets the candidates, and whatever acoustic properties they have, that's what the synthetic speech has" )
( shhssh_00115 "I'm now going to count how often each letter occurs" )
( shhssh_00116 "That is that they're distributed very unevenly" )
( shhssh_00117 "Let's pursue the idea of diphones for a moment" )
( shhssh_00118 "Now, even these simple descriptors  are probably not that simple" )
( shhssh_00119 "What should we record? Before proceeding, let's do the usual check" )
( shhssh_00120 "There's not a whole lot to do with perception in here" )
( shhssh_00121 "So could even use minimal pairs" )
( shhssh_00122 "We have an idea" )
( shhssh_00123 "It might be during development" )
( shhssh_00124 "That's not enough" )
( shhssh_00125 "We would choose the best path through that" )
( shhssh_00126 "Will a listener notice there's a join?" )
( shhssh_00127 "Here too, there's the third dimension" )
( shhssh_00128 "Imagine then adding all possible linguistic features and enumerating a very long wish list in this way" )
( shhssh_00129 "Things will also go wrong  when we generate the waveform" )
( shhssh_00130 "We could try and mitigate that by having multiple natural examples" )
( shhssh_00131 "The payoff is speed" )
( shhssh_00132 "Maybe you could have a neural network" )
( shhssh_00133 "Well, we have a choice" )
( shhssh_00134 "You can find it on the website speech" )
( shhssh_00136 "We'll think about what we're going   to ask our listeners to do" )
( shhssh_00137 "And it needs to obtain their response" )
( shhssh_00138 "So now on to how to do the evaluation" )
( shhssh_00139 "and so on, all with weights accordingly" )
( shhssh_00140 "How can we reduce the number of joins?" )
( shhssh_00141 "The first choice is: what kind of unit you're going to use" )
( shhssh_00142 "We can't push the errors back through them in the other direction" )
( shhssh_00143 "Maybe MFCCs" )
( shhssh_00144 "In other words, from a blank starting sheet without any prior information" )
( shhssh_00145 "Let's spell that out" )
( shhssh_00146 "We could keep doing that for all of the linguistic context factors that we think are important" )
( shhssh_00147 "This 3-state silence model (we'll typically call it silence, or something like that)" )
( shhssh_00148 "How should we record it? Do we need to be very careful about that?" )
( shhssh_00149 "Imagine considering choosing this unit" )
( shhssh_00150 "and you can imagine how many more there are" )
( shhssh_00151 "This is now when we're not allowed to  look inside and see how things work" )
( shhssh_00152 "So what can we do then?" )
( shhssh_00153 "We also know F0 for all the candidates" )
( shhssh_00155 "This model's just an HMM" )
( shhssh_00156 "I'm not sure what it is, because it doesn't matter!" )
( shhssh_00157 "Our text selection algorithm will have very likely provided us with a script in an order of decreasing richness" )
( shhssh_00158 "Therefore the signal that we observe - the waveform - is a result of several interacting processes" )
( shhssh_00159 "The exception to that would be an expert listener" )
( shhssh_00160 "We're going to make a plan" )
( shhssh_00161 "There's our distribution" )
( shhssh_00162 "So there are some modified versions, and they do work to some limited extent" )
( shhssh_00163 "So we can go off and fetch more from the database: we'll get all of them in fact" )
( shhssh_00164 "I'm going to do that for all of my labelled speech files" )
( shhssh_00165 "There's no guarantee of that" )
( shhssh_00166 "Now, there might be two of our own systems,  like the four variants of my great ideas" )
( shhssh_00167 "What motivates the method?" )
( shhssh_00168 "That's already a schwa, so can't be reduced any further" )
( shhssh_00169 "So, how open or closed is the vocal tract by the tongue?" )
( shhssh_00170 "Again we see the same sort of pattern we saw with letters" )
( shhssh_00171 "joining everything together" )
( shhssh_00172 "We're going to attach all the information to the phoneme tier" )
( shhssh_00173 "We'd like those sentences to be heard by a set of listeners" )
( shhssh_00174 "So here they are, and their weights" )
( shhssh_00175 "Now, precisely how we know that, we'll cover in the module on the database, a little bit later" )
( shhssh_00176 "There's variants on it, but this is the official MUSHRA design" )
( shhssh_00177 "What we now have then is a phonetic sequence with timestamps" )
( shhssh_00178 "Now there's already a huge number of assumptions in doing that" )
( shhssh_00179 "We just generalise that idea" )
( shhssh_00180 "Then I'll repeat that procedure" )
( shhssh_00181 "Yes, that's pulling out all of those" )
( shhssh_00182 "As we've described it so far, unit selection concatenates small fragments of waveform" )
( shhssh_00183 "That will fail to capture things like sudden changes of direction" )
( shhssh_00184 "These are very much research tools" )
( shhssh_00185 "All modern methods of speech synthesis - including unit selection that we've already covered - rely on a fairly substantial database of recorded natural speech" )
( shhssh_00186 "We just need to predict sufficient properties to enable a comparison with candidate units" )
( shhssh_00187 "Between words we always go through the short pause model, which can emit zero or more frames of silence" )
( shhssh_00188 "The square is called a Latin square" )
( shhssh_00189 "We compare it to our other ideas" )
( shhssh_00190 "We don't want a single listener's responses to have an undue influence on the overall statistics" )
( shhssh_00191 "But I ask only for comparisons" )
( shhssh_00192 "For example, in this piece of source code,   we can see who wrote it, so there's a  high chance there might be a bug here" )
( shhssh_00193 "On top of that phonetic labelling (or segmentation), we need to annotate the speech with all of the supra-segmental linguistic information: all the other things that the target cost might need to query" )
( shhssh_00194 "That's an articulatory process" )
( shhssh_00195 "And I'll take that idea forward and  the other ideas will stay on the shelf" )
( shhssh_00196 "We're working with features that have already been produced by our front-end" )
( shhssh_00197 "I'm using over a thousand sentences of transcribed speech here, and in those thousand sentences there are a couple of phonemes that occurred fewer than a hundred times, regardless of the context" )
( shhssh_00198 "We have measured things about their pupils" )
( shhssh_00199 "There's an example in the table of where a near match might be OK" )
( shhssh_00200 "We're going to use Taylor's terminology here, to be consistent with his book" )
( shhssh_00201 "As with most of the examples in this part of the course, I'm drawing my lattice in terms of whole phones because it's neater" )
( shhssh_00202 "We can push things through them one direction" )
( shhssh_00203 "We saw how the pronunciation model was simply the dictionary from our speech synthesizer with some rule-based vowel reduction" )
( shhssh_00204 "In a real system, the length of these lists of candidates will be much, much longer" )
( shhssh_00205 "I also know that they happen at the end of a line" )
( shhssh_00206 "We need to know a lot more about this database" )
( shhssh_00207 "Maybe there's a big F0 discontinuity" )
( shhssh_00208 "Let's go right back to how speech is produced" )
( shhssh_00209 "We'll explore all paths in parallel, this way" )
( shhssh_00210 "We're going to use a simple greedy algorithm" )
( shhssh_00211 "Unfortunately, if we enumerate all the possible contexts, they'll actually be pretty much infinite because context (theoretically at least) spans the entire sentence - possibly beyond" )
( shhssh_00212 "It's got the special property that each number appears in every row and every column just once" )
( shhssh_00213 "And then we look at the consistency across that to get a measure of how reliable our listening was" )
( shhssh_00215 "Occasionally we might measure speaker similarity" )
( shhssh_00216 "Unit selection errors might be that the units we  chose were from inappropriate contexts" )
( shhssh_00217 "We might prefer to have much, much shorter tasks" )
( shhssh_00219 "The states are these words, and we just join them up with arcs, with an end state and a start state" )
( shhssh_00220 "This is about the simplest possible algorithm" )
( shhssh_00221 "Now, you might be shouting out at this point that training the models on the same data we're aligning is cheating!" )
( shhssh_00222 "Also, the sort of variation we get in it might be unlike what we normally get in spoken language" )
( shhssh_00223 "They're in fact a part of international standards" )
( shhssh_00224 "The optional short pause model at the word juncture" )
( shhssh_00225 "There are a few types up here that are very frequent" )
( shhssh_00226 "Let's do it with speech this time: transcribed speech" )
( shhssh_00227 "Now I'd like to find out which of them was the best idea" )
( shhssh_00228 "The canonical pronunciation or the vowel reduction" )
( shhssh_00229 "We know that we keep coming across new words all the time" )
( shhssh_00230 "If you don't like that one, pick any other model you like" )
( shhssh_00231 "There's an advantage to being completely implicit" )
( shhssh_00232 "That's actually rarely used these days, much more common" )
( shhssh_00233 "For example, in the front end, things might go wrong very early in text normalisation, the wrong words are said" )
( shhssh_00234 "And now we need to think, how are they going to do on this task" )
( shhssh_00235 "I suggest doing it with words or with linguistic unit-types-in-context: perhaps something like triphones" )
( shhssh_00236 "That's going to help get us out of a sparsity problem" )
( shhssh_00237 "Let's summarize the key problems with diphone synthesis" )
( shhssh_00238 "We would like them to each synthesize the same set of sentences" )
( shhssh_00239 "We might actually go much smaller than that, and in online situations where we don't have control over the listeners, and they're listening situation where they're recruited via the Web" )
( shhssh_00240 "We can describe the linguistic context of a sound: for example, the preceding phoneme + the following phoneme" )

( shhssh_00245 "So each word could have its canonical pronunciation, like this" )

( shhssh_00249 "That makes the calculation really simple, but it is a weakness" )
( shhssh_00250 "So we would replace those targets with parameters: for example, F0 or some parameterization of the spectral envelope" )
( shhssh_00251 "Nevertheless, it will still need the database to learn that model" )
( shhssh_00252 "So there's an explosion (an exponential increase) in the number of types, just by taking one aspect of context into account" )
( shhssh_00253 "Perhaps our front end didn't predict a pause in that situation" )
