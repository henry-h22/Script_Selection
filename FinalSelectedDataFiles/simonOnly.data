( arctic_a0224 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist." )
( arctic_a0208 "Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression." )
( arctic_a0133 "Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength." )
( arctic_a0014 "Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_a0005 "Will we ever forget it." )
( arctic_a0207 "How much was it." )
( arctic_a0062 "The men stared into each other's face." )
( arctic_a0012 "Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet." )
( arctic_a0202 "She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face." )
( arctic_a0023 "A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges." )
( arctic_a0018 "There was a change now." )
( arctic_a0007 "And you always want to see it in the superlative degree." )
( arctic_a0124 "It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks." )
( arctic_a0024 "It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy." )
( arctic_a0086 "Death had come with terrible suddenness." )
( arctic_a0015 "It's the aurora borealis." )
( arctic_a0004 "Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil." )
( arctic_a0027 "To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor." )
( arctic_a0020 "Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories." )
( arctic_a0034 "Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children." )
( arctic_a0002 "Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore." )
( arctic_a0167 "I was near the cabin, and saw you." )
( arctic_a0038 "We'll have to watch our chances." )
( arctic_a0058 "I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else." )
( arctic_a0164 "He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0056 "Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly." )
( arctic_a0013 "He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique." )
( arctic_a0040 "I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here." )
( arctic_a0247 "They ought to pass here some time today." )
( arctic_a0022 "Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition." )
( arctic_a0093 "For a full minute he crouched and listened." )
( arctic_a0030 "I had faith in them." )
( arctic_a0026 "It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting." )
( arctic_a0067 "Surely I will excuse you, she cried." )
( arctic_a0047 "Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog." )
( arctic_a0052 "It was a curious coincidence." )
( arctic_a0060 "Anyway, no one saw her like that." )
( arctic_a0072 "But who was Eileen's double." )
( arctic_a0037 "I was the only one who remained sitting." )
( arctic_a0087 "Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man." )
( arctic_a0075 "There has been a change, she interrupted him." )
( arctic_a0010 "I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game." )
( arctic_a0041 "Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell." )
( arctic_a0050 "In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously." )
( arctic_a0074 "And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him." )
( arctic_a0101 "You, you would not keep the truth from me." )
( arctic_a0032 "Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step." )
( arctic_a0105 "Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe." )
( arctic_a0045 "He moved away as quietly as he had come." )
( arctic_a0044 "Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip." )
( arctic_a0191 "For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone." )
( arctic_a0095 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision." )
( arctic_a0134 "He obeyed the pressure of her hand." )
( arctic_a0131 "Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom." )
( arctic_a0106 "The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob." )
( arctic_a0066 "He saw Jeanne falter for a moment." )
( arctic_a0156 "A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned." )
( arctic_a0080 "What if Jeanne failed him." )
( arctic_a0128 "This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born." )
( arctic_a0076 "The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened." )
( arctic_a0053 "Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief." )
( arctic_a0090 "The singing voice approached rapidly." )
( arctic_a0069 "It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father." )
( arctic_a0122 "Two years ago I gave up civilization for this." )
( arctic_a0079 "It was a large canoe." )
( arctic_a0063 "Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger." )
( arctic_a0043 "It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson." )
( arctic_a0031 "They were three hundred yards apart." )
( arctic_a0130 "She was his now, forever." )
( arctic_a0055 "Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound." )
( arctic_a0091 "His blood grew hot with rage at the thought." )
( arctic_a0083 "A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes." )
( arctic_a0102 "He will follow us soon." )
( arctic_a0143 "Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_a0085 "A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face." )
( arctic_a0057 "I have no idea, replied Philip." )
( arctic_a0042 "How could he explain his possession of the sketch." )
( arctic_a0097 "Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow." )
( arctic_a0246 "You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi." )
( arctic_a0071 "What was the object of your little sensation." )
( arctic_a0065 "They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel." )
( arctic_a0019 "I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances." )
( arctic_a0089 "The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by." )
( arctic_a0098 "Shall I carry you." )
( arctic_a0092 "He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores." )
( arctic_a0077 "It is the fire, partly, she said." )
( arctic_a0025 "I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed." )
( arctic_a0082 "His face was streaming with blood." )
( arctic_a0115 "He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him." )
( arctic_a0114 "Her words sent a strange chill through Philip." )
( arctic_a0099 "A maddening joy pounded in his brain." )
( arctic_a0051 "The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow." )
( arctic_a0119 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward." )
( arctic_a0165 "They are to attack your camp tomorrow night." )
( arctic_a0068 "In a flash Philip followed its direction." )
( arctic_a0088 "He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling." )
( arctic_a0073 "The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them." )
( arctic_a0234 "Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil." )
( arctic_a0109 "Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you." )
( arctic_a0108 "He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself." )
( arctic_a0241 "I think it's much nicer to quarrel." )
( arctic_a0096 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest." )
( arctic_a0179 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said." )
( arctic_a0178 "Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated." )
( arctic_a0148 "Now these things had been struck dead within him." )
( arctic_a0039 "The ship should be in within a week or ten days." )
( arctic_a0243 "I only read the quotations." )
( arctic_a0094 "He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire." )
( arctic_a0117 "She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice." )
( arctic_a0036 "She turned in at the hotel." )
( arctic_a0189 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying." )
( arctic_a0188 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass." )
( arctic_a0127 "It was a temptation, but he resisted it." )
( arctic_a0125 "He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself." )
( arctic_a0120 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante." )
( arctic_a0132 "A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips." )
( arctic_a0195 "But a strange thing happened." )
( arctic_a0244 "He was the soul of devotion to his employers." )
( arctic_a0140 "Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this." )
( arctic_a0139 "He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes." )
( arctic_a0138 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0137 "Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure." )
( arctic_a0100 "You must sleep, he urged." )
( arctic_a0173 "The date was nearly eighteen years old." )
( arctic_a0145 "I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily." )
( arctic_a0054 "There was nothing on the rock." )
( arctic_a0221 "I don't know why you're here at all." )
( arctic_a0147 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness." )
( arctic_a0255 "You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that." )
( arctic_a0150 "Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted." )
( arctic_a0149 "For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky." )
( arctic_a0113 "I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians." )
( arctic_a0070 "He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there." )
( arctic_a0118 "Pierre obeys me when we are together." )
( arctic_a0153 "MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger." )
( arctic_a0152 "Philip thrust himself against it and entered." )
( arctic_a0151 "And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare." )
( arctic_a0110 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely." )
( arctic_a0182 "This time he did not yap for mercy." )
( arctic_a0155 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen." )
( arctic_a0107 "If you only could know how I thank you." )
( arctic_a0157 "He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice." )
( arctic_a0116 "Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin." )
( arctic_a0158 "Does that look good." )
( arctic_a0146 "Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued." )
( arctic_a0161 "Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub." )
( arctic_a0160 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt." )
( arctic_a0159 "They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life." )
( arctic_a0163 "Philip made no effort to follow." )
( arctic_a0162 "That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe." )
( arctic_a0112 "He was wounded in the arm." )
( arctic_a0144 "But there was something even more startling than this resemblance." )
( arctic_a0166 "Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding." )
( arctic_a0129 "Her face was against his breast." )
( arctic_a0104 "She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child." )
( arctic_a0168 "Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting." )
( arctic_a0172 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar." )
( arctic_a0171 "And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen." )
( arctic_a0170 "There was none of the joy of meeting in his face." )
( arctic_a0136 "About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age." )
( arctic_a0141 "It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God." )
( arctic_a0175 "Down there the earth was already swelling with life." )
( arctic_a0174 "They were the presage of storm." )
( arctic_a0142 "Such things had occurred before, he told Philip." )
( arctic_a0176 "For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap." )
( arctic_a0180 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed." )
( arctic_a0183 "And the air was growing chilly." )
( arctic_a0184 "Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two." )
( arctic_a0185 "The questions may have come vaguely in his mind." )
( arctic_a0219 "At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened." )
( arctic_a0186 "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl." )
( arctic_a0187 "Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine." )
( arctic_a0126 "Each day she became a more vital part of him." )
( arctic_a0123 "She had died from cold and starvation." )
( arctic_a0121 "They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours." )
( arctic_a0029 "Their forces were already moving into the north country." )
( arctic_a0190 "Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent." )
( arctic_a0192 "He did not rush in." )
( arctic_a0033 "He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson." )
( arctic_a0194 "He drank of the water cautiously." )
( arctic_a0211 "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made." )
( arctic_a0196 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog." )
( arctic_a0197 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose." )
( arctic_a0200 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more." )
( arctic_a0201 "He cried, and swung the club wildly." )
( arctic_a0203 "They were following the shore of a lake." )
( arctic_a0206 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau." )
( arctic_a0205 "From now on we're pals." )
( arctic_a0061 "Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him." )
( arctic_a0209 "It was not a large lake, and almost round." )
( arctic_a0111 "Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children." )
( arctic_a0210 "Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards." )
( arctic_a0216 "The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him." )
( arctic_a0215 "They die out of spite." )
( arctic_a0213 "Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound." )
( arctic_a0212 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman." )
( arctic_a0220 "A dead man is of no use on a plantation." )
( arctic_a0217 "Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive." )
( arctic_a0222 "What part of the United States is your home." )
( arctic_a0223 "My, I'm almost homesick for it already." )
( arctic_a0226 "That came before my A B C's." )
( arctic_a0225 "I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up." )
( arctic_a0231 "The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia." )
( arctic_a0230 "Do you know any good land around here." )
( arctic_a0229 "The last one I knew was an overseer." )
( arctic_a0228 "But it contributed to the smash." )
( arctic_a0227 "It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles." )
( arctic_a0233 "I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me." )
( arctic_a0232 "I cannot follow you, she said." )
( arctic_a0169 "Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant." )
( arctic_a0035 "He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes." )
( arctic_a0237 "So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves." )
( arctic_a0236 "Don't you see I hate you." )
( arctic_a0235 "His voice was passionately rebellious." )
( arctic_a0240 "Wash your hands of me." )
( arctic_a0239 "He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter." )
( arctic_a0238 "It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon." )
( arctic_a0177 "She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled." )
( arctic_a0242 "I saw it when she rolled." )
( arctic_a0249 "All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy." )
( arctic_a0248 "I had been sad too long already." )
( arctic_a0245 "Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year." )
( arctic_a0006 "God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever." )
( arctic_a0252 "O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals." )
( arctic_a0251 "I may manage to freight a cargo back as well." )
( arctic_a0250 "He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition." )
( arctic_a0253 "He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino." )
( arctic_a0254 "Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller." )
( arctic_a0048 "He looked at the handkerchief more, closely." )
( arctic_a0009 "He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table." )
( arctic_a0193 "It was edged with ice." )
( arctic_a0198 "Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions." )
( arctic_a0181 "So cheer up, and give us your paw." )
( arctic_a0084 "Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open." )
( arctic_a0049 "Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin." )
( arctic_a0028 "Robbery, bribery, fraud, " )
( arctic_a0021 "It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it." )
( arctic_a0016 "There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep." )
( arctic_a0011 "If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now." )
( arctic_a0008 "Gad, your letter came just in time." )
( arctic_a0003 "For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands." )
( arctic_a0001 "Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc." )
( arctic_a0199 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day." )
( arctic_a0081 "What if she did not come to the rock." )
( arctic_a0017 "From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy." )
( arctic_a0078 "Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her." )
( arctic_a0059 "His immaculate appearance was gone." )
( arctic_a0103 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe." )
( arctic_a0046 "The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear." )
( arctic_a0204 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him." )
