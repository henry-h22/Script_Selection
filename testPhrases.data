( henrySimon_22211 "For example, we're getting some spurious pitch marks where there's no voicing just because this unvoiced speech happens to have some energy around F0 by chance, and that happened to lead to some zero crossings" )
( henrySimon_22212 "Obviously, to do that, we need to add duration information, so we're going to have to have a duration model that helps us get from the linguistic timescale out to the fixed frame rate" )
( henrySimon_22213 "And we'll use that error as a signal to send back through the network to backpropagate, and it will tell the weights where they need to increase or decrease" )
( henrySimon_22214 "This could be as simple as a phoneme sequence, but for better results it will need to include supra-segmental information such as the prosody pattern of the speech to be produced" )

( henrySimon_22216 "The chief disadvantage is the relatively large time window over which the auto-correlation must be computed in order to cover adequately F0 ranges encountered in human speech" )
( henrySimon_22216 "Given Sp, p = 0,1,2,..., a sampled speech signal with sampling interval T = 1/Fs, analysis frame interval t, and analysis window size w at each frame we advance z = t/T samples with n = w/T samples in the autocorrelation window" )

( henrySimon_22216 "The model demonstrates how conditioning on prosodic information can significantly improve the convergence and quality of synthesized speech in a feed-forward model, enabling more coherent pronunciation across its independent outputs, and lead to state-of-the-art results" )
