( henrySimon_00017 "They will propagate" )
( henrySimon_00018 "I'll remove it from the large database" )
( henrySimon_00019 "But this is very uncommon these days" )
( henrySimon_00020 "We could predict simple acoustic things such as F0" )
( henrySimon_00021 "And that's called rounding" )
( henrySimon_00022 "Maybe then we can publish a paper" )
( henrySimon_00023 "I am going to shorten that" )
( henrySimon_00024 "So let's 'grep'" )
( henrySimon_00025 "Who those listeners might be" )
( henrySimon_00026 "We just get natural output" )
( henrySimon_00027 "We are better off using diphones" )
( henrySimon_00028 "Hopefully you're doing the exercise at the same time" )
( henrySimon_00029 "The motivation for that should be obvious" )

( henrySimon_00035 "We've got "context" which is the combination of linguistic features in the environment of this unit" )
( henrySimon_00036 "So it's a hybrid sorting on rating task" )
( henrySimon_00037 "Here's what our speaker said" )
( henrySimon_00038 "So to wrap this part up" )
( henrySimon_00039 "We have to look at the waveforms (i" )
( henrySimon_00040 "The function simply worked with symbolic features" )
( henrySimon_00041 "That doesn't need to be a full-blown N-gram" )

( henrySimon_00045 "Maybe we've taken lots of novels from Project Gutenberg" )
( henrySimon_00046 "So we should be talking about "base unit types in linguistic contexts"" )
( henrySimon_00047 "Or it has, optionally, vowel reduction like this" )
( henrySimon_00048 "Cepstral coefficients would be a good choice there" )
( henrySimon_00049 "There's a lattice of paths" )
( henrySimon_00050 "There's no guarantee of that" )
( henrySimon_00051 "Let's spell that out" )
( henrySimon_00052 "This is completely possible" )

( henrySimon_00057 "The key concepts that are involved" )
( henrySimon_00058 "This HMM now is an HMM of this little phrase" )

( henrySimon_00061 "it just takes a moment to run because we're going through this big document" )

( henrySimon_00066 "I'm now going to count how often each letter occurs" )
( henrySimon_00067 "and various other diphones have gone" )
( henrySimon_00068 "It's lower than all of the rest" )
( henrySimon_00069 "Everything else - for example prosody - had to be imposed using fairly extensive signal manipulation" )
( henrySimon_00070 "It might be hard to read newspaper sentences out loud" )
( henrySimon_00071 "We say those units are heterogeneous" )
( henrySimon_00072 "Do the readings to understand precisely what he means by that" )
( henrySimon_00073 "That's a rather cumbersome phrase!" )
( henrySimon_00074 "Think about why we even need to evaluate" )
( henrySimon_00075 "That's not enough" )
( henrySimon_00076 "And there is our kind-of classical Zipf-like distribution" )
( henrySimon_00077 "That's all we have to go on" )
( henrySimon_00078 "So how big to make the test" )
( henrySimon_00079 "We could do anything we like" )
( henrySimon_00080 "Go and do this on your own" )
( henrySimon_00081 "We decided when to do it" )
( henrySimon_00082 "The search will just find the best overall path" )
( henrySimon_00083 "Let's wrap up our discussion of the target cost function" )
( henrySimon_00084 "Before you look at this module, you should just  check that you already know the following things" )
( henrySimon_00085 "We go through the short pause model" )
( henrySimon_00086 "We could go further" )
( henrySimon_00087 "For example we could make a complete closure, and let sound pressure release in an explosive fashion" )
( henrySimon_00088 "We have to figure out that for ourselves" )
( henrySimon_00089 "Maybe you could write it in Python" )
( henrySimon_00090 "For example, are listeners able to give absolute judgements about naturalness played a single sample with no reference" )
( henrySimon_00091 "Now there's already a huge number of assumptions in doing that" )
( henrySimon_00092 "and you can imagine how many more there are" )
( henrySimon_00093 "So what we do, we form groups of subjects, which are the rows of this square" )
( henrySimon_00094 "So let's finish by looking forward to what's coming up" )
( henrySimon_00095 "This is essentially just a Hidden Markov Model" )
( henrySimon_00096 "That's easy" )
( henrySimon_00097 "We want to achieve that with the smallest possible database" )
( henrySimon_00098 "Let's draw the arcs on the network" )
( henrySimon_00099 "The task now is to choose amongst them" )
( henrySimon_00100 "This model's just an HMM" )
( henrySimon_00101 "We don't need coverage" )
( henrySimon_00102 "We won't consider these in any great depth here" )
( henrySimon_00103 "On top of that phonetic labelling (or "segmentation"), we need to annotate the speech with all of the supra-segmental linguistic information: all the other things that the target cost might need to query" )
( henrySimon_00104 "and so on, all with weights accordingly" )
( henrySimon_00105 "So now on to how to do the evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00106 "That's probably but maybe not saying it" )
( henrySimon_00107 "We can push things through them one direction" )
( henrySimon_00108 "Or is it down near the bottom?" )
( henrySimon_00109 "What the stimulus should be" )
( henrySimon_00110 "I've only got a tiny database in this toy example, so I just found 5" )
( henrySimon_00111 "Equally, we could predict values for duration or energy (all correlates of prosody)" )
( henrySimon_00112 "But that's an open question" )
( henrySimon_00113 "So far, we only know how to compare them in terms of linguistic features, which both have" )
( henrySimon_00114 "Where are we going to find them, while offering a payment is usually effective" )
( henrySimon_00115 "Those points might be described" )
( henrySimon_00116 "We might have the noise that's always going to make the task harder" )
( henrySimon_00117 "The acoustic predictions will have an intrinsic error in them" )
( henrySimon_00118 "Let's pursue the idea of diphones for a moment" )
( henrySimon_00119 "We could keep doing that for all of the linguistic context factors that we think are important" )
( henrySimon_00120 "Here too, there's the third dimension" )
( henrySimon_00121 "Will a listener notice there's a join?" )
( henrySimon_00122 "There's not a whole lot to do with perception in here" )
( henrySimon_00123 "Our pronunciation model is basically a dictionary" )
( henrySimon_00124 "That's what these red lines indicate" )
( henrySimon_00125 "Taken together, they are frequent" )
( henrySimon_00126 "I've rewritten segments as diphones" )
( henrySimon_00127 "We can't change the code for  the purpose of testing it" )
( henrySimon_00128 "We could try and mitigate that by having multiple natural examples" )
( henrySimon_00129 "The payoff is speed" )
( henrySimon_00130 "Well, we have a choice" )
( henrySimon_00131 "If the contours are identical, the RMSE is zero" )
( henrySimon_00132 "Maybe you could have a neural network" )
( henrySimon_00133 "They're not widely used in  synthetic speech evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00134 "We'll think about what we're going   to ask our listeners to do" )
( henrySimon_00135 "How can we reduce the number of joins?" )
( henrySimon_00136 "Those are not the same thing as perception" )
( henrySimon_00137 "And now we need to think, how are they going to do on this task" )
( henrySimon_00138 "In other words, from a blank starting sheet without any prior information" )
( henrySimon_00139 "Maybe MFCCs" )
( henrySimon_00140 "There's an example in the table of where a "near match" might be OK" )
( henrySimon_00141 "I'm going to use the letter as the unit" )
( henrySimon_00142 "Now, you might be shouting out at this point that training the models on the same data we're aligning is cheating!" )
( henrySimon_00143 "That's coming next" )
( henrySimon_00144 "Imagine considering choosing this unit" )
( henrySimon_00145 "Older systems used to be built like that" )
( henrySimon_00146 "For example: is it near the roof of the mouth?" )
( henrySimon_00147 "We'll explore all paths in parallel, this way" )
( henrySimon_00148 "We have to automate it" )
( henrySimon_00149 "You've built that voice and listened to it and so you're asking yourself now, "How good is that synthetic voice?" We need to evaluate that, so the topic of the next module will be evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00150 "So again, we will get more joins in our units" )
( henrySimon_00151 "We could try modifying PESQ which has been done" )
( henrySimon_00152 "I'm not sure what it is, because it doesn't matter!" )
( henrySimon_00153 "That is that they're distributed very unevenly" )
( henrySimon_00154 "We're going to make a plan" )
( henrySimon_00155 "We're working with features that have already been produced by our front-end" )
( henrySimon_00156 "We now have a complete picture of unit selection" )
( henrySimon_00157 "They don't have waveforms" )
( henrySimon_00158 "So we can go off and fetch more from the database: we'll get all of them in fact" )
( henrySimon_00159 "So there are some modified versions, and they do work to some limited extent" )
( henrySimon_00160 "Let's wrap this part up with a little orientation, putting ourselves in the bigger picture to see how far we've got, and what's coming up" )
( henrySimon_00161 "That's the most common choice" )
( henrySimon_00162 "What motivates the method?" )
( henrySimon_00163 "Unfortunately, if we enumerate all the possible contexts, they'll actually be pretty much infinite because context (theoretically at least) spans the entire sentence - possibly beyond" )
( henrySimon_00164 "That's already a schwa, so can't be reduced any further" )
( henrySimon_00165 "Then we could put zero join costs between pairs of half-phones that make up diphones" )
( henrySimon_00166 "Again we see the same sort of pattern we saw with letters" )
( henrySimon_00167 "We're going to attach all the information to the phoneme tier" )
( henrySimon_00168 "That's going to help get us out of a sparsity problem" )
( henrySimon_00169 "This state here is going to contain a Gaussian or Gaussian mixture model that emits observations with an appropriate distribution for silence" )
( henrySimon_00170 "We'd like those sentences to be heard by a set of listeners" )
( henrySimon_00171 "Which of those ideas was best?" )
( henrySimon_00172 "We're trying to guide   the future development of the system" )
( henrySimon_00173 "Our text selection algorithm will have very likely provided us with a script in an order of decreasing richness" )
( henrySimon_00174 "But we should exercise their use with caution and they're not a replacement for using listeners" )
( henrySimon_00175 "How should we record it? Do we need to be very careful about that?" )
( henrySimon_00176 "Then I'll repeat that procedure" )
( henrySimon_00177 "We just generalise that idea" )
( henrySimon_00178 "So Mel Cepstral distortion" )
( henrySimon_00179 "But there are some constraints" )
( henrySimon_00180 "Then we can combine the advantages of both types of sub-cost" )
( henrySimon_00181 "These are very much research tools" )
( henrySimon_00182 "So could even use minimal pairs" )
( henrySimon_00183 "We would choose the best path through that" )
( henrySimon_00184 "I'm going to write down my wish list" )
( henrySimon_00185 "We compare it to our other ideas" )
( henrySimon_00186 "We don't want a single listener's responses to have an undue influence on the overall statistics" )
( henrySimon_00187 "For example, in this piece of source code,   we can see who wrote it, so there's a  high chance there might be a bug here" )
( henrySimon_00188 "In fact, we won't even cut them up" )
( henrySimon_00189 "But I ask only for comparisons" )
( henrySimon_00190 "We might actually go much smaller than that, and in online situations where we don't have control over the listeners, and they're listening situation where they're recruited via the Web" )
( henrySimon_00191 "That's an articulatory process" )
( henrySimon_00192 "Let's think more generally about that" )
( henrySimon_00193 "That's a common term in speech coding" )
( henrySimon_00194 "And I'll take that idea forward and  the other ideas will stay on the shelf" )
( henrySimon_00195 "It's whatever the front-end might produce and whatever we might derive from that, such as these positional things" )
( henrySimon_00196 "And it needs to obtain their response" )
( henrySimon_00197 "I'm using over a thousand sentences of transcribed speech here, and in those thousand sentences there are a couple of phonemes that occurred fewer than a hundred times, regardless of the context" )
( henrySimon_00198 "And once we've finished evaluation, we  need to do something with what we've found" )
( henrySimon_00199 "We have measured things about their pupils" )
( henrySimon_00200 "The assumption here is that all subjects behave the same and that we can take five individual people, split the test across them and then aggregate the results" )
( henrySimon_00201 "Now, there might be two of our own systems,  like the four variants of my great ideas" )
( henrySimon_00202 "I was never taught this explicitly, and  I've never seen it really in a textbook" )
( henrySimon_00203 "We could look at the rate of change (the deltas)" )
( henrySimon_00204 "In a real system, the length of these lists of candidates will be much, much longer" )
( henrySimon_00205 "Underlying all of this there's an assumption" )
( henrySimon_00206 "the prosodic variation might be limited" )
( henrySimon_00207 "I also know that they happen at the end of a line" )
( henrySimon_00208 "Maybe there's a big F0 discontinuity" )
( henrySimon_00209 "We need to know a lot more about this database" )
( henrySimon_00210 "That's the process known as co-articulation" )
( henrySimon_00211 "Now, precisely how we know that, we'll cover in the module on the database, a little bit later" )
( henrySimon_00212 "We also know F0 for all the candidates" )
( henrySimon_00213 "And we put it in the listening test and in the same listening test are some variants on that system, which all are all really, really bad, our "quite good" system is going to get good scores" )
( henrySimon_00214 "Here's part of my very large text corpus, that I've put through my text-to-speech front end" )
( henrySimon_00215 "We're going to use a simple greedy algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00216 "An obvious one there is: if text normalisation goes  wrong - the synthesiser says the wrong words   and the listener understands the wrong thing" )
( henrySimon_00217 "This was covered in the course Speech Processing" )
( henrySimon_00218 "And then we look at the consistency across that to get a measure of how reliable our listening was" )
( henrySimon_00219 "Occasionally we might measure speaker similarity" )
( henrySimon_00220 "Unit selection errors might be that the units we  chose were from inappropriate contexts" )
( henrySimon_00221 "It's got the special property that each number appears in every row and every column just once" )
( henrySimon_00222 "We might prefer to have much, much shorter tasks" )
( henrySimon_00223 "This is about the simplest possible algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00224 "We just need to predict sufficient properties to enable a comparison with candidate units" )
( henrySimon_00225 "The number of concatenation points is the same" )
( henrySimon_00226 "The optional short pause model at the word juncture" )
( henrySimon_00227 "The exception to that would be an expert listener" )
( henrySimon_00228 "They're in fact a part of international standards" )
( henrySimon_00229 "A good way to do that would be dynamic time warping" )
( henrySimon_00230 "Imagine just asking for versions of each diphone in stressed and unstressed prosodic environments" )
( henrySimon_00231 "There are a few types up here that are very frequent" )
( henrySimon_00232 "That might be of individual components,   or the end-to-end system,  depending what we want to learn" )
( henrySimon_00233 "Let's do it with speech this time: transcribed speech" )
( henrySimon_00234 "We know that we keep coming across new words all the time" )
( henrySimon_00235 "If you don't like that one, pick any other model you like" )
( henrySimon_00236 "All modern methods of speech synthesis - including unit selection that we've already covered - rely on a fairly substantial database of recorded natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00237 "So, how open or closed is the vocal tract by the tongue?" )
( henrySimon_00238 "Let's convince ourselves that linguistic units of various types have got this Zipf-like distribution" )
( henrySimon_00239 "For example, in the front end,   things might go wrong very early in text normalisation,   the wrong words are said" )
( henrySimon_00240 "That's actually rarely used these days, much more common" )
( henrySimon_00241 "We're going to add a little rule-based pronunciation variation: we're going to allow every vowel to be reduced to schwa" )
( henrySimon_00242 "We might use throwaway listeners who are very unreliable" )
( henrySimon_00243 "I suggest doing it with words or with linguistic unit-types-in-context: perhaps something like triphones" )
( henrySimon_00244 "Let's summarize the key problems with diphone synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00245 "Now, you'll often see this curve called a Zipf distribution" )
( henrySimon_00246 "We can't push the errors back through them in the other direction" )
( henrySimon_00247 "We would like them to each synthesize the same set of sentences" )
( henrySimon_00248 "We can describe the linguistic context of a sound: for example, the preceding phoneme + the following phoneme" )
( henrySimon_00249 "We're going to use a technique borrowed from speech recognition" )
( henrySimon_00250 "As with most of the examples in this part of the course, I'm drawing my lattice in terms of whole phones because it's neater" )
( henrySimon_00251 "We'll compile this model with the pronunciation model, which essentially means replacing each word with its sub-word units" )
( henrySimon_00252 "We could throw away sentences with very low frequency or polysyllabic words that we think our speaker will find difficult" )
( henrySimon_00253 "It'll always give you the same sequence for the same input text" )
( henrySimon_00254 "So each word could have its canonical pronunciation, like this" )
( henrySimon_00255 "We're just going to sum up penalties for all of those mismatches" )
( henrySimon_00256 "That makes the calculation really simple, but it is a weakness" )
( henrySimon_00257 "We saw how the pronunciation model was simply the dictionary from our speech synthesizer with some rule-based vowel reduction" )
( henrySimon_00258 "Coming back to this terminology, we'll  sometimes see this term: "black box"" )
( henrySimon_00259 "So we would replace those targets with parameters: for example, F0 or some parameterization of the spectral envelope" )
( henrySimon_00260 "Now, even these simple descriptors  are probably not that simple" )
( henrySimon_00261 "What should we record? Before proceeding, let's do the usual check" )
( henrySimon_00262 "It would be better if we could soften that somewhat and say that that's a "near match" and maybe there should be a lower penalty in that case" )
( henrySimon_00263 "This is now when we're not allowed to  look inside and see how things work" )
( henrySimon_00264 "So for big differences, this measure is probably going to work, however, that relationship between Mel Cepstral Distortion and what listeners think isn't completely smooth and monotonic and so small differences are not going to be captured so reliably by this measure" )
( henrySimon_00265 "What we will do is look at a typical, simple approach to script design" )
( henrySimon_00266 "They're going to be given a task, and it's up to us what that task might be" )
( henrySimon_00267 "Let's pretend for a moment that these HMMs here are whole word models" )
( henrySimon_00268 "That seems a great idea because it's going to be be simple to deploy and it's going to be balanced because all listeners hear hear all stimuli" )
( henrySimon_00269 "The first one is not to stress the listeners out too much on very definitely not to allow them to become bored because their judgments might change" )
( henrySimon_00270 "This has got a fairly similar place of articulation to the desired (the target) left-phonetic-context of [b]" )
( henrySimon_00271 "We're not going to look in complete detail at the target cost function because that will come a little bit later, but we'll finish off by seeing how a search is conducted efficiently to find the optimal unit sequence" )
( henrySimon_00272 "And that would be our measure, and a large distance would imply less natural" )
( henrySimon_00273 "So that's about all we have to say about the evaluation of speech synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00274 "If there are N phoneme categories, there are about N^2 diphone types" )
( henrySimon_00275 "So here's our finite state network model of the pronunciation of the word /k ae n/, but it can also be reduced to /k ax n/" )
( henrySimon_00276 "The source of that weakness is the sparsity of these linguistic features, due to the extremely large number of permutations of possible values" )
( henrySimon_00277 "Now, of course there is one of the sequences that has the lowest total cost" )
( henrySimon_00278 "But it might be something else: maybe the other way around, or maybe something else" )
( henrySimon_00279 "If you're looking for a source of text to use in your own algorithm, the obvious choice is to go to Project Gutenberg where there's a repository of text of out of copyright novels, which you can scrape and use as a source of material" )
( henrySimon_00280 "We can't allow an individual subject to hear the same sentence more than once" )
( henrySimon_00281 "We still, though, might pay a little bit of attention to them and use some design text" )
( henrySimon_00282 "It's given me a sequence of phonemes, from which I've got the sequence of diphones" )
( henrySimon_00283 "Maybe we'll just take the log and then expressed these differences in semitones" )
( henrySimon_00284 "First we sort them into order, and then we'll put them through a tool called 'uniq'" )
( henrySimon_00285 "These have the nice property that within these lists, there's some phonetic balance" )
( henrySimon_00286 "There is a place where reasonably sophisticated models of perception in fact, things that have been fitted to perceptual data are widely used and are reliable" )
( henrySimon_00287 "And so it's possible to make a further contrast, for example between /p/ and /b/ by vibrating the vocal folds in the case of /b/" )
( henrySimon_00288 "Very often that will be done in a Web browser so that we could do these tests online" )
( henrySimon_00289 "But before I carry on, I'm going to cross off all the diphones that I got with that sentence" )
( henrySimon_00290 "Let's look at the sort of materials that are typical when testing intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00291 "We have to ask ourselves: Would it even be possible to record one example of every unit-in-context? Let's just point out a little shorthand in the language I'm using here" )
( henrySimon_00292 "It's tempting just to choose that - because we'll make an instant local decision - and then repeat that for each target position, choosing its candidate with the lowest target cost" )
( henrySimon_00293 "All my diagrams were using whole phones, although that's not really a sensible choice in practice" )
( henrySimon_00294 "But throughout all of this, let's always remember that were not yet able to replace listeners" )
( henrySimon_00295 "We might distract the listener with a parallel task that's increasing their cognitive load" )
( henrySimon_00296 "And the most common form of that are sometimes known as the Harvard or the IEEE sentences" )
( henrySimon_00297 "A nice advantage of a half-phone system is that it can sometimes make joins at phone boundaries" )
( henrySimon_00298 "There are other ways than semantically unpredictable sentences to avoid the ceiling effect" )
( henrySimon_00299 "We're going to combine that similarity measure with a join cost to enable smooth concatenation" )
( henrySimon_00300 "That sudden change from increasing to decreasing will also be unnatural: listeners might notice" )
( henrySimon_00301 "That way, we can say anything, but we try and use the biggest units available in the database" )
( henrySimon_00302 "Therefore, rather than just having these base units, we'll have context-dependent versions or "flavours" of those units" )
( henrySimon_00303 "Are we going to do that   for an end-to-end Text-to-Speech  system: text in, synthetic speech out" )
( henrySimon_00304 "But if you go back to look at the material on token passing, you'll realize that we can ask the tokens to remember anything at all while they're passing through the HMM states, not just the ends of words" )
( henrySimon_00305 "How on earth will we get any prosody at all? How is prosody created using such a cost function?" )
( henrySimon_00306 "I'm just using it to make the diagrams simpler to draw and simpler for you to understand" )
( henrySimon_00307 "So we know we need to evaluate: to make decisions,  for example, about where to go with our research" )
( henrySimon_00308 "Let's draw a picture of what it would be like for diphone units, just so we see that it can be done" )
( henrySimon_00309 "So once again, for the transmission of natural speech, which gets distorted in transmission on these things either measure the receive signal or the difference between the transmitted and received signal" )
( henrySimon_00310 "The states are these words, and we just join them up with arcs, with an end state and a start state" )
( henrySimon_00311 "We're going to measure the two  principal things that we can:   the naturalness and the intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00312 "Between words we always go through the short pause model, which can emit zero or more frames of silence" )
( henrySimon_00313 "Therefore the signal that we observe - the waveform - is a result of several interacting processes" )
( henrySimon_00314 "Also, the sort of variation we get in it might be unlike what we normally get in spoken language" )
( henrySimon_00315 "But in evaluating synthetic speech, we're usually more concerned with getting a lot of listeners" )
( henrySimon_00316 "There are methods out there to try and  probe people's effort or attention,   or all sorts of other factors" )
( henrySimon_00317 "So, I'd like you to go and play with this interactive example and then continue watching the videos" )
( henrySimon_00318 "You will see reports or evaluations that don't really say what they're looking for It's just preference" )
( henrySimon_00319 "We're going to do it in the only way we know how: that's the way that HTK does it in its simple HVite tool" )
( henrySimon_00320 "But intelligibility could also be impacted by   audible joins that disrupt the listener's perception" )
( henrySimon_00321 "We're going to have to use candidate units from mismatched non-identical linguistic contexts" )
( henrySimon_00322 "Imagine then adding all possible linguistic features and enumerating a very long wish list in this way" )
( henrySimon_00323 "In general, in a big system, we might find hundreds or thousands for some of the more common unit types" )
( henrySimon_00324 "So the questions we're going to answer in the next module are: Can we judge how good a synthetic voice is in isolation? Or, is it only possible to do that by comparing to some other system that's better or worse than it?" )
( henrySimon_00325 "That's a LOT of joins! We know that joins are the single biggest problem with unit selection speech synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00326 "We're just going to assume that our target cost is of the most simple IFF type when designing our database" )
( henrySimon_00327 "We're going to come back to that when we talk about the database, and we can see where these pseudo-features come from" )
( henrySimon_00328 "So we'll pull all of the waveform fragments out that have been labelled, in this case, with the phoneme /@/" )
( henrySimon_00329 "An obvious one is that we can put an [s] on the end of something to make the plural" )
( henrySimon_00330 "It seems a reasonable hypothesis that it's   hard work listening to synthetic  speech compared to natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00331 "It will be then easy to make a comparison between that predicted F0 and the true F0 of a candidate" )
( henrySimon_00332 "If you implement an algorithm, you may or may not actually construct this list, because it's going to be huge" )
( henrySimon_00333 "To get a better understanding of the issues in text selection, let's work through a rather simplified example" )
( henrySimon_00334 "Nevertheless, the number of possible contexts is still very, very large and that's going to be a problem" )
( henrySimon_00335 "So we could improve that: we could put several frames around the join and measure the join cost across multiple frames" )
( henrySimon_00336 "In other words, some of the linguistic environment has a very weak or negligible effect on the current sound" )
( henrySimon_00337 "Those were our ingredients for forced alignment: a language model, a pronunciation model and an acoustic model" )
( henrySimon_00338 "The most perceptible artefact we get in unit selection synthesis is sometimes those concatenation points, or "joins"" )
( henrySimon_00339 "For example, their fundamental frequency and their duration are strongly influenced by their position in the phrase" )
( henrySimon_00340 "One would hope that making an improvement  anywhere in the system would lead to an   improvement in the synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00341 "We'll do the same thing that we did for the letters: sort it,'uniq -c' it, and order it by frequency in reverse order" )
( henrySimon_00342 "We know that the beginning of the HMM aligns with the beginning of the audio, and the end of the HMM aligns with the end of the audio" )
( henrySimon_00343 "We made two in the Blizzard Challenge, and  indeed, in all sorts of internal testing   we'll keep certain things under control" )
( henrySimon_00344 "We're similarly going to quantify the difference in the spectral envelope just before the join and just after the join" )
( henrySimon_00345 "Therefore, we're going to have to quantify how good each join is, and take that into account when choosing the sequence of candidates" )
( henrySimon_00346 "The join cost then makes sure that we only choose sequences of candidates that will concatenate smoothly and imperceptibly" )
( henrySimon_00347 "So there's an explosion (an exponential increase) in the number of types, just by taking one aspect of context into account" )
( henrySimon_00348 "When we think we've got a pretty good system,   we might then go out and compare it somebody  else's system and hope that we're better" )
( henrySimon_00349 "Those interactions can actually  mean that improving something   early in the pipeline actually causes  problems later in the pipeline" )
( henrySimon_00350 "For the worked example, I'm going to actually just ignore linguistic context and try and get coverage just of diphones" )
( henrySimon_00351 "However, there are attempts to take these measures, which are typically big combinations of many, many different features and modify them" )
( henrySimon_00352 "So we made a first order solution to that which was just to capture the co-articulation between adjacent phones in the speech signal" )
( henrySimon_00353 "What we should understand so far is that a unit selection speech synthesizer has the same front end as as any other synthesizer" )
( henrySimon_00354 "Before starting on that, you need to make sure you already know the following things: The first area of importance is a little bit of phonetics" )
( henrySimon_00355 "So there's still an advantage of a pipeline architecture made of modules that we understand that we can take apart and we can replace" )
( henrySimon_00356 "If our base unit is the diphone, then our first N sentences (our first few hundred sentences) will be designed just to get one of each diphone" )
( henrySimon_00357 "And here we can see that all the points along the scale are described and when they've done that, they submit their score and move on to the next sample" )
( henrySimon_00358 "Both of those are competing to affect F0, but this function just considers them independently, and just accumulates the penalties" )
( henrySimon_00359 "That's a reasonable criticism of them, but they will take us away from the ceiling effect and help us to differentiate between different systems" )
( henrySimon_00360 "This is to make sure we have particularly good coverage in these smaller domains, so our voice will perform particularly well on these domains" )
( henrySimon_00361 "If we were to plot those numbers (and I'll let you do that for yourself, maybe in a spreadsheet) we'd see that has this Zipf-like decaying distribution" )
( henrySimon_00362 "What makes unit selection synthesis feasible? The answer is that some (hopefully very many) linguistic contexts lead to about the same speech sound" )
( henrySimon_00363 "Well, very simply by choosing candidates from an appropriate context - for example, phrase final - we'll get appropriate prosody automatically" )
( henrySimon_00364 "Let's examine each of those points in a little bit more detail and make them concrete with some examples of how they might appear to a listener by far and away" )
( henrySimon_00365 "You're going to find out that for yourself in the exercise! Because written text was not usually intended to be read aloud, its readability might be poor" )
( henrySimon_00366 "We're going to look at the match / mismatch between each candidate in turn and that target specification, and compute the target cost for each of them" )
( henrySimon_00367 "At each place is possibly used several different manners of making the sound and those are arranged on the vertical axis, not in any particular order" )
( henrySimon_00368 "It's the job of the target cost to measure similarity (or distance) between units in the database - which we call candidates - and the target specification" )
( henrySimon_00369 "We have better models, and so we could indeed today envisage predicting a complete acoustic specification - in fact, all the way to the waveform if you wanted" )
( henrySimon_00370 "If we miss here a word, how do we know we've misheard it? So I would never recommend the use of opinion scores or MUSHRA or anything like that to rate intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00371 "Now, the context is potentially unbounded: it certainly spans the sentence in which we find the unit and we may even want to consider features beyond the sentence" )
( henrySimon_00372 "That's neat, because we can just run our algorithm and select a very large script and go into the studio and record for as long as (for example) we have money" )
( henrySimon_00373 "Whereas perhaps in a more complex sound, such as a liquid or a diphthong, with a complex and changing spectral envelope, it's more difficult to hide the joins in those sounds" )
( henrySimon_00374 "But this use off a single natural reference as gold standard is obviously flawed for the reason that we've already stated: there is more than one correct way of saying any sentence" )
( henrySimon_00375 "Now there's a whole lot of terminology flying  around testing, whether it's software testing   or whole system testing, whatever it might be,  we're not really going to get bogged down in it" )
( henrySimon_00376 "So to that extent that will correlate with listeners judgments very high cepstral distortion would suggest that they'll say they sound very different or if played only the synthetic sample" )
( henrySimon_00377 "We're going to look at a more sophisticated form of target cost now, where we predict some acoustic properties for the targets and compare those with actual acoustic properties of candidates" )
( henrySimon_00378 "We might also put a lower bound a bottom sample in that we know should always be worse than all of the systems that's known as the anchor, not obvious what that would be for synthetic speech, so it's not currently used" )
( henrySimon_00379 "We want maximum variation, so that our target cost function has a lot of candidates to choose amongst for each target position, and that our join cost function can find nice smooth joins between those candidates" )
( henrySimon_00380 "Using data where we just have a word transcription that's only aligned at the sentence level is so important and is the standard way of training an automatic speech recognition system, it comes with a special name" )
( henrySimon_00381 "Evaluation is obviously playing a critical role  in this because it's helping us to make the   decision that this was the best, and this was the  best, and that the route our research should take   should be like this, not some other path" )
( henrySimon_00382 "We're going to see that's a general trend   in evaluation: that we might be able to measure  something in the synthetic speech, but that thing   that we measure doesn't have a direct connection  back to only one property of the system" )
( henrySimon_00383 "The way I've just described that is in terms of linguistic features: effectively counting how many linguistic features (for example left phonetic context, or syllable stress, or position in phrase) match and how many mis-match" )
( henrySimon_00384 "The first feature is place and that's where in the mouth the sound is made and in particular with a consonant where some sort of constriction is formed and in the IPA chart those are arranged along the horizontal axis of this table" )
( henrySimon_00385 "Plotting those distributions of frequencies-of-types, from the most frequent to the least frequent (ordering them by their frequency of occurrence) and then plotting their frequency on this axis we always tend to get this sort of shape, this decaying curve" )
( henrySimon_00386 "The obvious ones are going to be the pitch (or the physical underlying property: fundamental frequency / F0), the energy - if speech suddenly gets louder or quieter we will notice that, if it's in an unnatural way - and, more generally, the overall spectral characteristics" )
( henrySimon_00387 "So what we're really looking for is not to cover every possible context (because that's impossible), it's to cover a wide variety of contexts so that the target cost and the join cost can between them choose units that don't mismatch too badly in linguistic features, and join together well" )
( henrySimon_00388 "The sort of things that you might include in your script design might be: choosing sentences that are easy to read out loud, so that your speaker can say them fluently without too many mistakes; you might want to cover low-frequency linguistic forms such as questions; you might want to boost the coverage of phrase-final and phrase-initial units, because in long sentences they're very rare; and you might want to include some domain-specific material, if you think your final system is going to be more frequently used in a particular domain (for example, reading out the news, or reading out emails, or something really simple like telling the time)" )
( henrySimon_00389 "And eventually we'll join together the statistical parametric method and the unit selection method for something called hybrid synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00390 "We'll probably still want coverage in that database, although it might not be as important as in unit Selection" )
( henrySimon_00391 "We'll still need a database" )
( henrySimon_00392 "And what we've talked about in this module on evaluation, all still applies" )
( henrySimon_00393 "Of course, we will want to evaluate that synthesis from the statistical parametric method" )
( henrySimon_00394 "And what you've learned in this unit selection part will still be highly relevant for several reasons" )
( henrySimon_00395 "What we'll move on to next is a different form of synthesis, and that's called Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00396 "And it's all about unit selection, the data behind it and how to evaluate it" )
( henrySimon_00397 "Well, we've reached the end of the first part of the course" )
( henrySimon_00398 "In this case, if we're really not sure what we're asking listeners to do, we're just saying, Do you like this system more or this other system more and all you can really do is forced choice preference test, because you're not really telling them what to listen to it all, just an overall preference that would also be appropriate for choosing between two different voices, which was most pleasant, for example, which is different to naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00399 "They're implying natural" )
( henrySimon_00400 "The only exception to That might be if there are only a couple of possible things they could hear, such as in minimal pairs, and you could possibly do a forced choice" )
( henrySimon_00401 "But fine distinctions" )
( henrySimon_00402 "How do you know whether you've understood something? Okay, so if something is perfectly intelligible or very unintelligible, then we could make a judgement on that and give an opinion" )
( henrySimon_00403 "It's hard to see where that will be acceptable" )
( henrySimon_00404 "One thing you'll find in the literature and indeed in some standards, is the use of the opinion scores to rate intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00405 "This is probably fine" )
( henrySimon_00406 "You could use forced choice to say which of the two sounds more like a particular target speaker Judging whether something is or is not a target speaker is a slightly odd task for listeners because in real life, someone either is or is not the target making graded distinctions maybe a little bit tricky" )
( henrySimon_00407 "Obviously, with a reference sample of what the target speakers supposed to sound like" )
( henrySimon_00408 "Similarity to Target Speaker is essentially the same sort of task is naturalness, so people tend to do MOS or MUSHRA type tests" )
( henrySimon_00409 "I can't immediately think of a task that you could ask listeners to do other than those things from which you could gauge the naturalness of a signal" )
( henrySimon_00410 "And a forced choice is also perfectly okay, because it's quite a straightforward task to explain to listeners which of these two sample sounds the most natural" )
( henrySimon_00411 "It's perfectly good to use Mean Opinion Score very often on a five point scale that you might like a seven point scale for some reason, or something that's closely related to that which is MUSHRA, which has a built in error checking and calibration mechanism" )
( henrySimon_00412 "What tests should you pick? Naturalness is the most common thing to be evaluated" )
( henrySimon_00413 "Let's finish off with a table of recommendations about what test to use to measure what property, so depending what you want to evaluate" )
( henrySimon_00414 "Of course, that great big machine learning black box isn't a final solution, because although we might be able to learn in an end-to-end fashion When it does make mistakes, we really can't point to any part of the system to blame for it because it's a black box" )
( henrySimon_00415 "And that's one direction to field is heading into - something that's learnable in an end to end fashion and not just in a modular fashion" )
( henrySimon_00416 "If we had a complete end-to-end machine learning approach to the problem, for example, a great big neural net that went all the way from text to a waveform, we could imagine now back propagating errors through the system" )
( henrySimon_00417 "Now that's because these pipeline architectures are simply not invertable" )
( henrySimon_00418 "For example, the front end, the database, the signal processing, whatever we haven't changed must be identical, so there are no confounds when we do this evaluation and find that one of the variants was better and take it forward, we're then, assuming that it was our change that was responsible for that, what we can't do easily is do a listening test, Look at the result of it and somehow back propagate that through the pipeline of the text-to-speech system and find that it was the letter to sound system that was to blame" )
( henrySimon_00419 "So when we look at these 1, 2, 3, 4 systems, the only difference between them must be the thing we changed and everything else must be kept constant" )
( henrySimon_00420 "We need to make sure there's no confounding factors" )
( henrySimon_00421 "We need a very sensitive evaluation that can detect that and tell us to take that improvement forward and to leave the others behind" )
( henrySimon_00422 "Brilliant idea may have made only a very small improvement in the quality of the synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00423 "And let's just wrap up by reminding ourselves why we were doing that in the first place and looking again at what to do with the outcome of that So let's just repeat our diagram of how research works and, indeed, how development works We need carefully controlled experiments to tell the differences between, for example, these four system variants that might be all very similar" )
( henrySimon_00424 "So it's the evaluation of synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00425 "We could evaluate things about the system, but mainly we wanted evaluate the speech itself" )
( henrySimon_00426 "It's not a good predictor of what listeners would say if we did the proper listening test" )
( henrySimon_00427 "Unfortunately, that number's pretty meaningless" )
( henrySimon_00428 "That's tempting to think we could just apply those two synthetic speech, and they will give us a number" )
( henrySimon_00429 "There are standards out there, like PESQ" )
( henrySimon_00430 "They're not yet good enough to replace listeners, but they are now correlating, roughly speaking with listeners opinions" )
( henrySimon_00431 "For example, modify the weights in this waited combination and fit those weights to listening test results for synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00432 "So we can't just take these black boxes and use them to evaluate the naturalness of synthetic speech, pretending that synthetic species just a distorted form of natural speech because the distortions are completely different to the sort of distortions we get in transmission of speech" )
( henrySimon_00433 "As they stand - certainly you can say for PESQ - they don't well correlate, or they don't in fact correlate at all with listeners opinions of synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00434 "These both standards the exist in software implementation and they're used widely by telecommunications companies" )
( henrySimon_00435 "The standard measure until recently was called PESQ and recently, there's a new, better measure being proposed that's called POLQA" )
( henrySimon_00436 "And that's from the field of telecommunications" )
( henrySimon_00437 "And so it seems reasonable to try and put much more complex perceptual model into our objective measure" )
( henrySimon_00438 "We could put a little perceptual knowledge, but not a lot" )
( henrySimon_00439 "We might put that onto a perceptual scale" )
( henrySimon_00440 "In F0 we might not do it on Hertz" )
( henrySimon_00441 "The cepstrum might be Mel cepstrum to get some perceptual warping" )
( henrySimon_00442 "But these are very simple, low level, signal processing based measures" )
( henrySimon_00443 "We might want to report these results alongside subjective results and if there's a disagreement, we'll probably believe the subjective result, and not this objective measure" )
( henrySimon_00444 "They're actually quite close to the measures were minimising when training statistical models anyway" )
( henrySimon_00445 "They have some uses, a development tool because they could be done very quickly during development without going out to listeners" )
( henrySimon_00446 "So the summary message for the simple objective measures is: you'll find them widely used and reported in the literature, especially for statistical parametric synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00447 "And our one reference contour isn't the only way of saying the sentence, and so error won't perfectly correlate with listeners' opinions" )
( henrySimon_00448 "But once again, there are lots of valid natural contours" )
( henrySimon_00449 "If they're radically different, we get a large error, and that's a prediction of unnatural this" )
( henrySimon_00450 "And we would expect listeners to say this prosody was perfect or perfectly natural" )
( henrySimon_00451 "Again this has some reasonable properties" )
( henrySimon_00452 "For example, whether they have peaks in the same place" )
( henrySimon_00453 "Correlation would measure the similarity in the shapes of these two things" )
( henrySimon_00454 "Perhaps just this absolute difference or the mean squared difference and sum that up across so that we get this root mean squared error" )
( henrySimon_00455 "We'll look at local differences" )
( henrySimon_00456 "We'll have to make some alignment between synthetic and natural" )
( henrySimon_00457 "Let's move on to the other common thing to measure objectively, and that's F0 and here again" )
( henrySimon_00458 "That's something to think about for yourself" )
( henrySimon_00459 "Would this measure capture naturalness of unit selection speech" )
( henrySimon_00460 "It might not be the same as the natural reference, but it's perfectly natural" )
( henrySimon_00461 "Something to think about for yourself is, would this measure make sense for synthetic speech made by concatenation of wave forms, remembering that those are locally, essentially, perfectly natural, so any local frame is natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00462 "It's very much the same thing that we're actually minimising when we're training our systems And so it's a possible measure of system performance or of predicted naturalness of the final speech" )
( henrySimon_00463 "Nevertheless, this distance measure or distortion in the mel cepstral domain is very widely used in a statistical parametric synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00464 "And in system development, as we incrementally improve our system, it's actually small differences that we really want to measure the most" )
( henrySimon_00465 "And zero distortion means the synthetic is identical to natural" )
( henrySimon_00466 "They would say that sounds very unnatural" )
( henrySimon_00467 "If the two signals were extremely different, distortion would be high and that seems reasonable" )
( henrySimon_00468 "If these two signals were identical than the distortion would be zero, that seems reasonable" )
( henrySimon_00469 "Now this is a pretty low level signal measure is the same sort of thing we might do in speech recognition to say if two things were the same or different, but it's got some properties that seem reasonable" )
( henrySimon_00470 "That'll be Mel Cepstral Distortion" )
( henrySimon_00471 "Then we'll just sum that up for every frame off the utterance" )
( henrySimon_00472 "compare these two things on measure the difference or distortion" )
( henrySimon_00473 "And in the cepstral domain" )
( henrySimon_00474 "We'll do the same here" )
( henrySimon_00475 "Here we might extract the spectral envelope represent that with cepstrum" )
( henrySimon_00476 "This is just a spectrum with frequency here and magnitude" )
( henrySimon_00477 "So those two were aligned by the dynamic time warping and we'll extract from this one" )
( henrySimon_00478 "Maybe we'll take that frame there on its corresponding frame" )
( henrySimon_00479 "And then we could take frames that have been aligned with one another and look at the local difference" )
( henrySimon_00480 "That's just going to make some non linear alignment between these two sequences, matching up the most similar sound with the most similar sound" )
( henrySimon_00481 "We'll do some procedure of alignment" )
( henrySimon_00482 "So we'll extract some features" )
( henrySimon_00483 "So if we've got a natural and a synthetic version of a sentence, the first thing of course we're going to do is make some alignment between them" )
( henrySimon_00484 "Let's just see what properties those measures are looking at" )
( henrySimon_00485 "So for F0 we might have a pair of measures: Error and Correlation" )
( henrySimon_00486 "It has peaks in the right places, for example" )
( henrySimon_00487 "If we produce a synthetic F0 contour that essentially has the right shape but is offset or is its amplitude is a little bit too big or too small, we would still predict that sounds very nice to listeners" )
( henrySimon_00488 "And so we might also measure the shape of the two contours with something like correlation" )
( henrySimon_00489 "That has a problem that if there's just a small offset between the two that will turn up to look like rather a large error" )
( henrySimon_00490 "That's just a sum of local differences" )
( henrySimon_00491 "And sum those up and calculate the root mean squared error between those two contours" )
( henrySimon_00492 "My just look at the difference in Hertz or some other units between the natural and synthetic contours" )
( henrySimon_00493 "For an F0 contour, there's a couple of different things we might measure" )
( henrySimon_00494 "And one thing that we know off that does that is the Mel Cepstrum" )
( henrySimon_00495 "We would want to do that in a representation that's, somehow relevant to perception, captures some perceptual properties" )
( henrySimon_00496 "For the special envelope, we just think about a distortion of the difference between natural and synthetic" )
( henrySimon_00497 "For example, spectral envelope and the stuff that might correlate with prosody, F0 contour, maybe energy" )
( henrySimon_00498 "And the properties are the obvious things, the stuff that might correlate with phonetic identity" )
( henrySimon_00499 "These simple, objective measures are just based on properties of the signal" )
( henrySimon_00500 "We can't really capture all of the possible valid and correct natural ways of saying a sentence" )
( henrySimon_00501 "So the method, as it stands, fails to account for natural variation" )
( henrySimon_00502 "And then we'll sum the local differences, and that will be some total distance" )
( henrySimon_00503 "Or we could force out synthesisers to generate speech with the same durational pattern is a natural reference" )
( henrySimon_00504 "So we're going to align the natural and synthetic that could be just, say, dynamic, time warping" )
( henrySimon_00505 "Most objective measures are just a sum of local differences" )
( henrySimon_00506 "It also assumes that distance between a synthetic sample on this natural reference is somehow going to indicate what listeners would have said about it is going to correlate with their opinion score" )
( henrySimon_00507 "And there are many, many possible ways" )
( henrySimon_00508 "But any natural speaker's rendition of a sentence is just one possible way of saying that sentence" )
( henrySimon_00509 "First of all, it assumes that natural speech is somehow gold standard, and we can't do better than that" )
( henrySimon_00510 "The reference will be natural speech and the comparison will probably be just some distance" )
( henrySimon_00511 "Simple, objective measures involve just comparing synthetic speech to a reference" )
( henrySimon_00512 "Think about why it would be non trivial, and then we'll look at what can be done so far" )
( henrySimon_00513 "So let's turn our minds then to whether an objective measure is even possible" )
( henrySimon_00514 "Or we might use some more sophisticated model and the model will try and take account of human perception" )
( henrySimon_00515 "It might be a simpler is measuring distances between synthetic speech and a reference sample, which is almost certainly going to be natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00516 "In an objective test, we have an algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00517 "So is that possible? In a subjective test, we have subjects, and they express perhaps an opinion about the synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00518 "So we're using the word objectively here to imply that listeners are subjective" )
( henrySimon_00519 "It would be nice if we could find a measure an algorithm perhaps that could evaluate objectively" )
( henrySimon_00520 "Now, while using listeners to evaluate your synthetic speech is by far the most common thing to do" )
( henrySimon_00521 "It might be some other domain" )
( henrySimon_00522 "It could be the domain of usage of the system" )
( henrySimon_00523 "Just pull them from some domain" )
( henrySimon_00524 "We can use relatively normal sentence" )
( henrySimon_00525 "Naturalness more straightforward" )
( henrySimon_00526 "Naturalness is more straightforward because we can use normal sentences" )
( henrySimon_00527 "Maybe you can think off some novel ways to avoid the ceiling effect without using rather unnatural, semantically unpredictable sentences" )
( henrySimon_00528 "But in this case, we're now starting to worry again that we're measuring something about the listeners ability and not about synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00529 "And so what they're trying to capture is not the effects of synthetic speech, but the effects of a transmission channel and the degradations it's imposed upon original natural speech, so these don't always automatically translate to the synthetic speech situation" )
( henrySimon_00530 "You need to be a little bit careful about just simply applying these standards because they're almost exclusively developed for measuring natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00531 "There are other standards out there for measuring intelligibility as there are for Naturalness and for quality" )
( henrySimon_00532 "And those lists might be of words of controlled frequency, medium frequency words or so on" )
( henrySimon_00533 "These could be generated by algorithm from template or a set of template sentences into which slots we drop words from some lists" )
( henrySimon_00534 "in fact, fairly standard is to use semantically unpredictable sentences" )
( henrySimon_00535 "This is very, very time consuming because we're getting one small data point from this full sentence" )
( henrySimon_00536 "They differing one phonetic feature and we can tell if I synthesizer is making that error" )
( henrySimon_00537 "We'll say gold again" )
( henrySimon_00538 "Now we will say cold again" )
( henrySimon_00539 "A simpler way off doing intelligibility testing that gets us down to specific individual errors is to use minimal pairs and will typically embed them in sentences because it's nicer for the listener" )
( henrySimon_00540 "That could be very important, especially in system development" )
( henrySimon_00541 "These are very far from actual system usage" )
( henrySimon_00542 "The standard way of making the task harder for listeners is to make the sentences less predictable and we tend to pick things that are syntactically correct, because otherwise it would sound very unnatural but semantically unpredictable because they kind of have conflicting meanings within them" )
( henrySimon_00543 "We can't tell if they're both synthesising such easy material, and so we have to pull them apart by making things harder for listeners" )
( henrySimon_00544 "One might be more intelligible than the other" )
( henrySimon_00545 "But it's not useful experimentally because we can't tell the difference between different systems" )
( henrySimon_00546 "Now that's success in the sense that our system works" )
( henrySimon_00547 "They're basically perfectly intelligible" )
( henrySimon_00548 "We'll tend to get a ceiling effect" )
( henrySimon_00549 "The problem with these sentences is that in quiet conditions, which we hope our listeners are in" )
( henrySimon_00550 "We would perhaps prefer to use nice, normal sentences, either from the domain of application or pull from a source such as a newspaper" )
( henrySimon_00551 "That's gonna be a lot more pleasant for listeners" )
( henrySimon_00552 "Or more likely we'll use full sentences to get bit more variety, but also to make things a little harder to analyse" )
( henrySimon_00553 "But it's still possible" )
( henrySimon_00554 "That's not so common these days" )
( henrySimon_00555 "So we might sometimes even want to use isolated words to narrow down the range of possible errors a listener can make and make our analysis much simpler" )
( henrySimon_00556 "That might conflict with other requirements of evaluation and the sort of analysis we might want to do, particularly if we want to test intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00557 "If our systems for a particular domain, maybe it's a personal assistant, we would probably want to synthesise this sentences in that domain on measure its performance, saying naturalness on such sentences" )
( henrySimon_00558 "But what sentences are we actually going to synthesise and play to the listeners? In other words, what are the materials we should use Now there's a possible tension when choosing the materials to record" )
( henrySimon_00559 "They might be pull down menus or type in boxes and if it's necessary, and it very often is, using this between subjects design to remove the problem of repeated stimuli" )
( henrySimon_00560 "We looked at various test interfaces" )
( henrySimon_00561 "We decided what the task might be, such as typing in or choosing from a five point scale" )
( henrySimon_00562 "So we're talking still about subjective evaluation, in other words, using listeners and getting them to do a task" )
( henrySimon_00563 "And that's crucial in intelligibility because they will remember those sentences" )
( henrySimon_00564 "Okay, we got into a bit of detail there about a very specific listening test design, although it is a very highly recommended one and it's widely used, particularly in the Blizzard Challenge, to make sure that we don't have effects off repeated presentation of the same text to a listener" )
( henrySimon_00565 "And then we just aggregate the opinions or the responses in this case, the type in responses, for example, word error rates across all subjects to form our final statistics" )
( henrySimon_00566 "But no individual human being ever hears the same sentence twice" )
( henrySimon_00567 "This virtual listener, composed of five human beings, listens like this through the Latin square and they hear every synthesiser saying every sentence" )
( henrySimon_00568 "So we put the same number of people in each row" )
( henrySimon_00569 "And if we want more than five, we need multiples of five" )
( henrySimon_00570 "And so we need to have at least five people" )
( henrySimon_00571 "So we've got five individual subjects, but they're grouped together in forming a single virtual listener" )
( henrySimon_00572 "We need to balance the design by taking another subject and listening to the sentences said by a different permutation off the synthesisers and work our way down these rows" )
( henrySimon_00573 "So we need to complete that" )
( henrySimon_00574 "So that's not fair, because sentence A might be easier to synthesise then sentence B so at the moment System zero has an unfair advantage" )
( henrySimon_00575 "Now, when this subject has completed this row of the square, they've heard every synthesiser Well each synthesiser was only saying a single sentence" )
( henrySimon_00576 "Their relative judgments will be affected by having heard both the best and the worst synthesiser and not only bad ones are only good ones" )
( henrySimon_00577 "And then this achieves the property that we only hear each sentence once, but the subjects hearing all the different synthesises so they'll be somehow calibrated" )
( henrySimon_00578 "So they'll typing in what they heard, and then they'll move on and they'll hear the next one on the listening across a row of this Latin Square, and you'll notice that they're going to hear every sentence just once each and each time, it said, by a different synthesiser, different number in that cell" )
( henrySimon_00579 "So they must make one pass through one row of the Matrix, and they can't do any of the other rows" )
( henrySimon_00580 "Now here we're doing an intelligibility task where it's absolutely crucial that no subject hear's the same sentence more than once" )
( henrySimon_00581 "And they would perform a task" )
( henrySimon_00582 "So we'll take one of our subjects and they will listen across a row of this square, so they will hear Sentence A said by synthesiser number zero" )
( henrySimon_00583 "The square is called a Latin square" )
( henrySimon_00584 "Now that means it's not possible for a single subject to do the whole listening test because that would involve hearing every sentence synthesised by all five synthesisers" )
( henrySimon_00585 "Here they're called subjects" )
( henrySimon_00586 "So five synthesisers" )
( henrySimon_00587 "Here I've numbered them: 0 1 2 3 4" )
( henrySimon_00588 "The goals of the following that we have a set of synthesisers" )
( henrySimon_00589 "So I'm now going to explain one type of between subjects design that achieves a few very important goals" )
( henrySimon_00590 "Every pair, every A/B pair is played in the order, A followed by B and somewhere else in the test it's played as B followed by A so all pairs of repeated" )
( henrySimon_00591 "One way to do that in a forced choice - a pairwise test - is simply to repeat a pair, ideally in the opposite order and in fact, in some pairwise listening tests" )
( henrySimon_00592 "So to check listeners are consistent and not random" )
( henrySimon_00593 "In both designs, whether it's within subjects or between subjects, we can build various forms of quality control, and the simplest one is actually to deliberately repeat some items and make sure they give about the same judgement in the repeated case" )
( henrySimon_00594 "In other words, there's no memory carry over effect from listener to listener, so we can effectively make a virtual listener who doesn't have a memory" )
( henrySimon_00595 "On the essence of this design, is we form a virtual single subject from a group of people such that we can split the memory effect such that one thing heard by one listener can't possibly affect another thing heard by a different listener because they don't communicate with each other" )
( henrySimon_00596 "And that design is called between subjects" )
( henrySimon_00597 "So if we worried about these effects we're going to have to have a different sort of design" )
( henrySimon_00598 "Or ordering, for example, if we hear a really good synthesiser, then a really bad synthesiser, the bad one's score will be even lower because of that ordering effect" )
( henrySimon_00599 "In other words having heard one thing the response with some other thing changes" )
( henrySimon_00600 "But there's a more complex and much more important reason that we might not have a within subjects design, and that's because we might not want to play certain sequences or certain combinations of stimulus to the one listener, and that's because there might be effects off priming" )
( henrySimon_00601 "So we would have to split that across multiple listeners" )
( henrySimon_00602 "If we want to compare so many different systems and we sure we need many different texts, we simply can't fit all of that into a 45 minute test or a lot less" )
( henrySimon_00603 "One of them is obvious" )
( henrySimon_00604 "But there are two situations where it's not possible to do that" )
( henrySimon_00605 "They all hear the same stimuli and the most we might do is to put them in a different random order for each listener" )
( henrySimon_00606 "In other words, all listeners individually, each hear everything" )
( henrySimon_00607 "Far and away the easiest thing to do in the listening test is to construct one listening test and then just to repeat the same test with many different listeners" )
( henrySimon_00608 "And our test design might combine numbers of listeners and numbers of sentences as we're going to see in a bit, so the number of sentences might be determined for us by our number of systems And the number of listeners that we want to use" )
( henrySimon_00609 "And so again the only way to mitigate that is to use as many different sentences as possible" )
( henrySimon_00610 "It's possible that one sentence is a typical favours one system over another, just out of luck" )
( henrySimon_00611 "The same applies to the material text that we synthesise and then play to listeners" )
( henrySimon_00612 "I would say we need at least 20 listeners in any reasonable listening test, and preferably always more than that, maybe 30 or more" )
( henrySimon_00613 "And the only way to do that is to have a lot of different listeners" )
( henrySimon_00614 "Because one individual listener might be atypical - they might just hear synthetic speech in a different way, they might have different preferences to the population" )
( henrySimon_00615 "So a test duration of 45 minutes is actually really quite long, and we certainly wouldn't want to go beyond that" )
( henrySimon_00616 "Such as system A is better than system B, but what we can have is some pretty useful rules of thumb that we can use in all listening tests that we know from experience tends to lead to reliable results" )
( henrySimon_00617 "And so we're not going to go into the nitty gritty of exactly how the size of a sample determines the statistical power that we would need to make confident statements" )
( henrySimon_00618 "Now, this is definitely not a course on statistics" )
( henrySimon_00619 "And it catches listeners who are not doing the task properly, so it some quality control and some calibration" )
( henrySimon_00620 "But the idea of having this hidden reference is very useful because it both calibrates it provides a reference to listen to" )
( henrySimon_00621 "So this forces them to listen to everything, and it gives some calibration" )
( henrySimon_00622 "It instructs the listener that one of these eight stimulate is in fact the reference, and then they must give it a score of 100 and in fact, they're not allowed to move on to the next set until they do so" )
( henrySimon_00623 "MUSHRA builds in a nice form of quality control" )
( henrySimon_00624 "And then we have a set of stimuli, that we have to listen to: in this test there are eight so we can see you can do a lot of samples side by side and for each of them, the user, the listener has to choose a score, but in doing so is also implicitly sorting the systems" )
( henrySimon_00625 "We have a reference that we could listen to that would be natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00626 "There's variants on it, but this is the official MUSHRA design" )
( henrySimon_00627 "And here are some examples on these scales and finally, that MUSHRA design, which is an international standard" )
( henrySimon_00628 "For example, a paragraph from an audio book and we might try and get things that are not just naturalness, but maybe some of those sub-dimensions of naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00629 "We won't go into a lot of detail on this one, but we could ask for multiple judgments on the same stimulus that might be particularly appropriate if the stimulus is long" )
( henrySimon_00630 "And other designs are possible" )
( henrySimon_00631 "Certainly they would take longer to do the test" )
( henrySimon_00632 "And that's another design decision we have to to make: would their judgement change if they're allowed to listen many, many times" )
( henrySimon_00633 "In this particular design they're only allowed to listen to the speech once" )
( henrySimon_00634 "If we're asking them to transcribe what they heard, maybe that the interface would look like this some way of playing the audio and a place to type in their text" )
( henrySimon_00635 "Here is the pull down menu, but it could equally be boxes to tick, which is one option" )
( henrySimon_00636 "It's got on audio player, in this case, the listener can listen as many times as they want, and it's got a way of giving the response" )
( henrySimon_00637 "So here's a typical interface" )
( henrySimon_00638 "So mean opinion score is the most common by far, and that's because the most common thing we want to evaluate his naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00639 "We'll look a test in a moment that's called MUSHRA that attempts to take the best of the pairwise forced choice, which essentially relative and the MOS, which is essentially absolute and the idea of calibration by providing reference samples, putting all of that into a single test design that's intuitive for listeners and has some nice properties for us" )
( henrySimon_00640 "And we might include some references and might even hybridise rating and sorting" )
( henrySimon_00641 "There are variations on this that aren't just pairwise forced choice so we might use more than two stimuli" )
( henrySimon_00642 "A is better or B is better" )
( henrySimon_00643 "We could just have two options" )
( henrySimon_00644 "That's optional" )
( henrySimon_00645 "And if they always to choose that, then we know that these systems are hard to tell apart" )
( henrySimon_00646 "If you want to capture the strength of the preference, you might also put in a don't care or equally natural or can't tell the difference sort of option" )
( henrySimon_00647 "So ask only for relative judgments, so we'll give them multiple things to listen to, and the most obvious thing is two things, and we'll ask them to say which do they prefer" )
( henrySimon_00648 "One solution to this problem of not being able to get truly absolute calibrated opinions from listeners is not to ask for them at all" )
( henrySimon_00649 "We need to worry about that" )
( henrySimon_00650 "So we might get a different score for the same system, depending on the context around it In other words, listeners probably do recalibrate themselves according to what they've heard recently more elsewhere in the test" )
( henrySimon_00651 "So just give everything a score of three" )
( henrySimon_00652 "They can't tell the difference between them" )
( henrySimon_00653 "It's not really good" )
( henrySimon_00654 "It's very likely our listeners in that case, we'll just give everything three, which is halfway between one and five, because it's not really bad" )
( henrySimon_00655 "In fact, it's really hard to tell the difference between them, so they're all somewhere in the middle" )
( henrySimon_00656 "We put exactly the same system in its still quite good, but it's mixed in with some other variants on the system, and they're also quite good" )
( henrySimon_00657 "Let's imagine another version of the test" )
( henrySimon_00658 "It's not perfect, but it's quite good" )
( henrySimon_00659 "Maybe our listeners going to keep scoring four out of five because it's quite good" )
( henrySimon_00660 "I would have to design that in to understand To understand why there's this difference between the task being absolute in terms of the judgement the listener gives and the test not necessarily being repeatable or comparable: imagine we have a system that's quite good" )
( henrySimon_00661 "So in other words, it's not necessarily repeatable, and it's certainly not necessary comparable across listening tests" )
( henrySimon_00662 "However, that does not mean that if we repeat this task, another time will get exactly the same judgments" )
( henrySimon_00663 "However, we must be very careful to not conflate two things It's absolute in the sense that it's all a single stimulus, and we expect the listener to be able to do that task without reference to some baseline or some top line" )
( henrySimon_00664 "It's not relative to anything else" )
( henrySimon_00665 "Now, here we have to call this an absolute judgement because that score is on a scale of 1 to 5, and it's on a single stimulus" )
( henrySimon_00666 "We call that the mean opinion score" )
( henrySimon_00667 "And in this test, listeners hear a single stimulus in isolation, typically one sentence and then they give a judgement on that single stimulus, and then we take the average of those on DH" )
( henrySimon_00668 "The most common sort of listening test is one that attempts to measure the naturalness of the speech synthesiser" )
( henrySimon_00669 "Or is it because the listeners weren't paying attention? So we want some quality control and that would be built in to the test design as we're going through" )
( henrySimon_00670 "And importantly, how do we know that they're doing the job well? So, for example, when we failed to find any difference between two systems, is it because really there was no difference?" )
( henrySimon_00671 "Maybe it doesn't matter" )
( henrySimon_00672 "What type of listener are they? Maybe they should be native speakers" )
( henrySimon_00673 "Sometimes they're called subjects" )
( henrySimon_00674 "And something that we might talk about as we go through these points in detail, but always keep in mind the listeners themselves" )
( henrySimon_00675 "And how many listeners to do this with? So I need to think about the size of the test" )
( henrySimon_00676 "And what remains then, is how many samples to play them" )
( henrySimon_00677 "So we decided to get let's say, relative judgments from listeners, present them with a reference stimulus, and then the things they've got to judge - get them to, for example, choose from a pull down menu from a five point scale and get their response back" )
( henrySimon_00678 "That's pretty straightforward" )
( henrySimon_00679 "It needs to present the stimulus" )
( henrySimon_00680 "And that needs an interface" )
( henrySimon_00681 "When we've decided then whether our listeners needs some help calibrating their judgments or whether they can be relied upon to give absolute, in other words, repeatable judgments every time with a need to present, stimulated them and get these judgments back" )
( henrySimon_00682 "But there are other references, such as a standard speech synthesis system that never changes as our prototype system gets better" )
( henrySimon_00683 "And the most obvious reference, of course, is natural speech itself" )
( henrySimon_00684 "So many times we might want to make a safer assumption that listeners make relative judgments and one way to be sure that they're always making relative judgments and to give some calibration to that is to include some references" )
( henrySimon_00685 "If you've just heard a very unnatural system and then a more natural system, your rating would be inflated by that" )
( henrySimon_00686 "That's possibly not true for things like naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00687 "Are they going to reliably rate it always as a three out of five? If we think that's true, we could design the task that relies on this absolute nature of listeners judgments" )
( henrySimon_00688 "These are what we're going to concentrate on So we've decided to give our listeners a simple and obvious task" )
( henrySimon_00689 "It's not so common: by far and away the most common thing is to give a very obvious task and either pairwise or Likert scale type tasks or typing test for intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00690 "Doing this more sophisticated analysis - here is something called multi-dimensional scaling, which projects the differences into a space and then we can interpret the axes - is not really mainstream" )
( henrySimon_00691 "Those judgements about difference in this pairwise forced choice test" )
( henrySimon_00692 "If we wanted a deeper analysis than simply a preference, an alternative to training the listeners is to give them what appears to be a very simple task and then you some sophisticated statistical analysis to untangle what they actually did and to measure, for example, on what dimensions they were making" )
( henrySimon_00693 "That such a simple, obvious task, they can do it without any further instructional training" )
( henrySimon_00694 "We'll just assume as, for example, as native speakers of the language, they were able to choose between two things and express a preference" )
( henrySimon_00695 "But naive listeners, the one we can recruit on the street and pay to do our listening test in general would not be trained" )
( henrySimon_00696 "For example, the linguist, the native speaker in a company listening to a system - a prototype system - and giving specific feedback on what's wrong with it" )
( henrySimon_00697 "So this is quite uncommon in evaluating synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00698 "It's quite time consuming, and we could be never certain that they've completely learned to do what we ask them to do" )
( henrySimon_00699 "And if we want a lot of listeners and they're going to listen to a lot of material and we're going to repeat test many times, training listeners is a bit problematic" )
( henrySimon_00700 "And so we might ask, Should we train the listeners in order to, for example, pay attention to specific aspects of speech? This idea of training is pretty common in experimental phonetics, where we would like the listeners to do something very specific to attend to a particular acoustic property" )
