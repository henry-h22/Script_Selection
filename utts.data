( henrySimon_00136 "We'll think about what we're going   to ask our listeners to do" )
( henrySimon_00137 "And it needs to obtain their response" )
( henrySimon_00138 "So now on to how to do the evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00139 "and so on, all with weights accordingly" )
( henrySimon_00140 "How can we reduce the number of joins?" )
( henrySimon_00141 "The first choice is: what kind of unit you're going to use" )
( henrySimon_00142 "We can't push the errors back through them in the other direction" )
( henrySimon_00143 "Maybe MFCCs" )
( henrySimon_00144 "In other words, from a blank starting sheet without any prior information" )
( henrySimon_00145 "Let's spell that out" )
( henrySimon_00146 "We could keep doing that for all of the linguistic context factors that we think are important" )
( henrySimon_00147 "This 3-state silence model (we'll typically call it silence, or something like that)" )
( henrySimon_00148 "How should we record it? Do we need to be very careful about that?" )
( henrySimon_00149 "Imagine considering choosing this unit" )
( henrySimon_00150 "and you can imagine how many more there are" )
( henrySimon_00151 "This is now when we're not allowed to  look inside and see how things work" )
( henrySimon_00152 "So what can we do then?" )
( henrySimon_00153 "We also know F0 for all the candidates" )
( henrySimon_00154 "It would be better if we could soften that somewhat and say that that's a "near match" and maybe there should be a lower penalty in that case" )
( henrySimon_00155 "This model's just an HMM" )
( henrySimon_00156 "I'm not sure what it is, because it doesn't matter!" )
( henrySimon_00157 "Our text selection algorithm will have very likely provided us with a script in an order of decreasing richness" )
( henrySimon_00158 "Therefore the signal that we observe - the waveform - is a result of several interacting processes" )
( henrySimon_00159 "The exception to that would be an expert listener" )
( henrySimon_00160 "We're going to make a plan" )
( henrySimon_00161 "There's our distribution" )
( henrySimon_00162 "So there are some modified versions, and they do work to some limited extent" )
( henrySimon_00163 "So we can go off and fetch more from the database: we'll get all of them in fact" )
( henrySimon_00164 "I'm going to do that for all of my labelled speech files" )
( henrySimon_00165 "There's no guarantee of that" )
( henrySimon_00166 "Now, there might be two of our own systems,  like the four variants of my great ideas" )
( henrySimon_00167 "What motivates the method?" )
( henrySimon_00168 "That's already a schwa, so can't be reduced any further" )
( henrySimon_00169 "So, how open or closed is the vocal tract by the tongue?" )
( henrySimon_00170 "Again we see the same sort of pattern we saw with letters" )
( henrySimon_00171 "joining everything together" )
( henrySimon_00172 "We're going to attach all the information to the phoneme tier" )
( henrySimon_00173 "We'd like those sentences to be heard by a set of listeners" )
( henrySimon_00174 "So here they are, and their weights" )
( henrySimon_00175 "Now, precisely how we know that, we'll cover in the module on the database, a little bit later" )
( henrySimon_00176 "There's variants on it, but this is the official MUSHRA design" )
( henrySimon_00177 "What we now have then is a phonetic sequence with timestamps" )
( henrySimon_00178 "Now there's already a huge number of assumptions in doing that" )
( henrySimon_00179 "We just generalise that idea" )
( henrySimon_00180 "Then I'll repeat that procedure" )
( henrySimon_00181 "Yes, that's pulling out all of those" )
( henrySimon_00182 "As we've described it so far, unit selection concatenates small fragments of waveform" )
( henrySimon_00183 "That will fail to capture things like sudden changes of direction" )
( henrySimon_00184 "These are very much research tools" )
( henrySimon_00185 "All modern methods of speech synthesis - including unit selection that we've already covered - rely on a fairly substantial database of recorded natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00186 "We just need to predict sufficient properties to enable a comparison with candidate units" )
( henrySimon_00187 "Between words we always go through the short pause model, which can emit zero or more frames of silence" )
( henrySimon_00188 "The square is called a Latin square" )
( henrySimon_00189 "We compare it to our other ideas" )
( henrySimon_00190 "We don't want a single listener's responses to have an undue influence on the overall statistics" )
( henrySimon_00191 "But I ask only for comparisons" )
( henrySimon_00192 "For example, in this piece of source code,   we can see who wrote it, so there's a  high chance there might be a bug here" )
( henrySimon_00193 "On top of that phonetic labelling (or "segmentation"), we need to annotate the speech with all of the supra-segmental linguistic information: all the other things that the target cost might need to query" )
( henrySimon_00194 "That's an articulatory process" )
( henrySimon_00195 "And I'll take that idea forward and  the other ideas will stay on the shelf" )
( henrySimon_00196 "We're working with features that have already been produced by our front-end" )
( henrySimon_00197 "I'm using over a thousand sentences of transcribed speech here, and in those thousand sentences there are a couple of phonemes that occurred fewer than a hundred times, regardless of the context" )
( henrySimon_00198 "We have measured things about their pupils" )
( henrySimon_00199 "There's an example in the table of where a "near match" might be OK" )
( henrySimon_00200 "We're going to use Taylor's terminology here, to be consistent with his book" )
( henrySimon_00201 "As with most of the examples in this part of the course, I'm drawing my lattice in terms of whole phones because it's neater" )
( henrySimon_00202 "We can push things through them one direction" )
( henrySimon_00203 "We saw how the pronunciation model was simply the dictionary from our speech synthesizer with some rule-based vowel reduction" )
( henrySimon_00204 "In a real system, the length of these lists of candidates will be much, much longer" )
( henrySimon_00205 "I also know that they happen at the end of a line" )
( henrySimon_00206 "We need to know a lot more about this database" )
( henrySimon_00207 "Maybe there's a big F0 discontinuity" )
( henrySimon_00208 "Let's go right back to how speech is produced" )
( henrySimon_00209 "We'll explore all paths in parallel, this way" )
( henrySimon_00210 "And we put it in the listening test and in the same listening test are some variants on that system, which all are all really, really bad, our "quite good" system is going to get good scores" )
( henrySimon_00211 "We're going to use a simple greedy algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00212 "Unfortunately, if we enumerate all the possible contexts, they'll actually be pretty much infinite because context (theoretically at least) spans the entire sentence - possibly beyond" )
( henrySimon_00213 "It's got the special property that each number appears in every row and every column just once" )
( henrySimon_00214 "And then we look at the consistency across that to get a measure of how reliable our listening was" )
( henrySimon_00215 "The first one is not to stress the listeners out too much on very definitely not to allow them to become bored because their judgments might change" )
( henrySimon_00216 "Occasionally we might measure speaker similarity" )
( henrySimon_00217 "Unit selection errors might be that the units we  chose were from inappropriate contexts" )
( henrySimon_00218 "We might prefer to have much, much shorter tasks" )
( henrySimon_00219 "So here's our finite state network model of the pronunciation of the word /k ae n/, but it can also be reduced to /k ax n/" )
( henrySimon_00220 "The states are these words, and we just join them up with arcs, with an end state and a start state" )
( henrySimon_00221 "This is about the simplest possible algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00222 "Now, you might be shouting out at this point that training the models on the same data we're aligning is cheating!" )
( henrySimon_00223 "Also, the sort of variation we get in it might be unlike what we normally get in spoken language" )
( henrySimon_00224 "They're in fact a part of international standards" )
( henrySimon_00225 "The optional short pause model at the word juncture" )
( henrySimon_00226 "There are a few types up here that are very frequent" )
( henrySimon_00227 "Let's do it with speech this time: transcribed speech" )
( henrySimon_00228 "Now I'd like to find out which  of them was the best idea" )
( henrySimon_00229 "The canonical pronunciation or the vowel reduction" )
( henrySimon_00230 "We know that we keep coming across new words all the time" )
( henrySimon_00231 "If you don't like that one, pick any other model you like" )
( henrySimon_00232 "There's an advantage to being completely implicit" )
( henrySimon_00233 "That's actually rarely used these days, much more common" )
( henrySimon_00234 "For example, in the front end,   things might go wrong very early in text normalisation,   the wrong words are said" )
( henrySimon_00235 "An obvious one is that we can put an [s] on the end of something to make the plural" )
( henrySimon_00236 "And now we need to think, how are they going to do on this task" )
( henrySimon_00237 "I suggest doing it with words or with linguistic unit-types-in-context: perhaps something like triphones" )
( henrySimon_00238 "That's going to help get us out of a sparsity problem" )
( henrySimon_00239 "Let's summarize the key problems with diphone synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00240 "We would like them to each synthesize the same set of sentences" )
( henrySimon_00241 "We might actually go much smaller than that, and in online situations where we don't have control over the listeners, and they're listening situation where they're recruited via the Web" )
( henrySimon_00242 "We can describe the linguistic context of a sound: for example, the preceding phoneme + the following phoneme" )
( henrySimon_00243 "We're trying to guide   the future development of the system" )
( henrySimon_00244 "We'll compile this model with the pronunciation model, which essentially means replacing each word with its sub-word units" )
( henrySimon_00245 "We could throw away sentences with very low frequency or polysyllabic words that we think our speaker will find difficult" )
( henrySimon_00246 "Coming back to this terminology, we'll  sometimes see this term: "black box"" )
( henrySimon_00247 "So each word could have its canonical pronunciation, like this" )
( henrySimon_00248 "It'll always give you the same sequence for the same input text" )
( henrySimon_00249 "Then we can combine the advantages of both types of sub-cost" )
( henrySimon_00250 "We're just going to sum up penalties for all of those mismatches" )
( henrySimon_00251 "That makes the calculation really simple, but it is a weakness" )
( henrySimon_00252 "So we would replace those targets with parameters: for example, F0 or some parameterization of the spectral envelope" )
( henrySimon_00253 "Nevertheless, it will still need the database to learn that model" )
( henrySimon_00254 "So there's an explosion (an exponential increase) in the number of types, just by taking one aspect of context into account" )
( henrySimon_00255 "Perhaps our front end didn't predict a pause in that situation" )
( henrySimon_00256 "However, there are attempts to take these measures, which are typically big combinations of many, many different features and modify them" )
( henrySimon_00257 "So for big differences, this measure is probably going to work, however, that relationship between Mel Cepstral Distortion and what listeners think isn't completely smooth and monotonic and so small differences are not going to be captured so reliably by this measure" )
( henrySimon_00258 "You've built that voice and listened to it and so you're asking yourself now, "How good is that synthetic voice?" We need to evaluate that, so the topic of the next module will be evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00259 "What we will do is look at a typical, simple approach to script design" )
( henrySimon_00260 "They're going to be given a task, and it's up to us what that task might be" )
( henrySimon_00261 "Let's pretend for a moment that these HMMs here are whole word models" )
( henrySimon_00262 "You should go and try this for yourself with a much bigger set of types" )
( henrySimon_00263 "That seems a great idea because it's going to be be simple to deploy and it's going to be balanced because all listeners hear hear all stimuli" )
( henrySimon_00264 "And that would be our measure, and a large distance would imply less natural" )
( henrySimon_00265 "This has got a fairly similar place of articulation to the desired (the target) left-phonetic-context of [b]" )
( henrySimon_00266 "We're not going to look in complete detail at the target cost function because that will come a little bit later, but we'll finish off by seeing how a search is conducted efficiently to find the optimal unit sequence" )
( henrySimon_00267 "So that's about all we have to say about the evaluation of speech synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00268 "Put in test cases with known correct  output and compare against them" )
( henrySimon_00269 "The source of that weakness is the sparsity of these linguistic features, due to the extremely large number of permutations of possible values" )
( henrySimon_00270 "Now, of course there is one of the sequences that has the lowest total cost" )
( henrySimon_00271 "But it might be something else: maybe the other way around, or maybe something else" )
( henrySimon_00272 "If you're looking for a source of text to use in your own algorithm, the obvious choice is to go to Project Gutenberg where there's a repository of text of out of copyright novels, which you can scrape and use as a source of material" )
( henrySimon_00273 "We still, though, might pay a little bit of attention to them and use some design text" )
( henrySimon_00274 "We can't allow an individual subject to hear the same sentence more than once" )
( henrySimon_00275 "And once we've finished evaluation, we  need to do something with what we've found" )
( henrySimon_00276 "It's given me a sequence of phonemes, from which I've got the sequence of diphones" )
( henrySimon_00277 "Maybe we'll just take the log and then expressed these differences in semitones" )
( henrySimon_00278 "The assumption here is that all subjects behave the same and that we can take five individual people, split the test across them and then aggregate the results" )
( henrySimon_00279 "First we sort them into order, and then we'll put them through a tool called 'uniq'" )
( henrySimon_00280 "These have the nice property that within these lists, there's some phonetic balance" )
( henrySimon_00281 "There is a place where reasonably sophisticated models of perception in fact, things that have been fitted to perceptual data are widely used and are reliable" )
( henrySimon_00282 "I was never taught this explicitly, and  I've never seen it really in a textbook" )
( henrySimon_00283 "And so it's possible to make a further contrast, for example between /p/ and /b/ by vibrating the vocal folds in the case of /b/" )
( henrySimon_00284 "Very often that will be done in a Web browser so that we could do these tests online" )
( henrySimon_00285 "But before I carry on, I'm going to cross off all the diphones that I got with that sentence" )
( henrySimon_00286 "Let's look at the sort of materials that are typical when testing intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00287 "We have to ask ourselves: Would it even be possible to record one example of every unit-in-context? Let's just point out a little shorthand in the language I'm using here" )
( henrySimon_00288 "It's tempting just to choose that - because we'll make an instant local decision - and then repeat that for each target position, choosing its candidate with the lowest target cost" )
( henrySimon_00289 "But throughout all of this, let's always remember that were not yet able to replace listeners" )
( henrySimon_00290 "And the most common form of that are sometimes known as the Harvard or the IEEE sentences" )
( henrySimon_00291 "We might distract the listener with a parallel task that's increasing their cognitive load" )
( henrySimon_00292 "All my diagrams were using whole phones, although that's not really a sensible choice in practice" )
( henrySimon_00293 "But we should exercise their use with caution and they're not a replacement for using listeners" )
( henrySimon_00294 "There are other ways than semantically unpredictable sentences to avoid the ceiling effect" )
( henrySimon_00295 "A nice advantage of a half-phone system is that it can sometimes make joins at phone boundaries" )
( henrySimon_00296 "We're going to combine that similarity measure with a join cost to enable smooth concatenation" )
( henrySimon_00297 "That way, we can say anything, but we try and use the biggest units available in the database" )
( henrySimon_00298 "That sudden change from increasing to decreasing will also be unnatural: listeners might notice" )
( henrySimon_00299 "Therefore, rather than just having these base units, we'll have context-dependent versions or "flavours" of those units" )
( henrySimon_00300 "Are we going to do that   for an end-to-end Text-to-Speech  system: text in, synthetic speech out" )
( henrySimon_00301 "So we know we need to evaluate: to make decisions,  for example, about where to go with our research" )
( henrySimon_00302 "We saw how the language model is just derived from the sentences that we ask the speaker to read" )
( henrySimon_00303 "But if you go back to look at the material on token passing, you'll realize that we can ask the tokens to remember anything at all while they're passing through the HMM states, not just the ends of words" )
( henrySimon_00304 "How on earth will we get any prosody at all? How is prosody created using such a cost function?" )
( henrySimon_00305 "Let's draw a picture of what it would be like for diphone units, just so we see that it can be done" )
( henrySimon_00306 "I'm just using it to make the diagrams simpler to draw and simpler for you to understand" )
( henrySimon_00307 "If our dictionary was more sophisticated and had full pronunciation variation capabilities, that could be expressed in a finite state form and would become part of the alignment network" )
( henrySimon_00308 "So once again, for the transmission of natural speech, which gets distorted in transmission on these things either measure the receive signal or the difference between the transmitted and received signal" )
( henrySimon_00309 "We're going to measure the two  principal things that we can:   the naturalness and the intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00310 "But in evaluating synthetic speech, we're usually more concerned with getting a lot of listeners" )
( henrySimon_00311 "There are methods out there to try and  probe people's effort or attention,   or all sorts of other factors" )
( henrySimon_00312 "So, I'd like you to go and play with this interactive example and then continue watching the videos" )
( henrySimon_00313 "You will see reports or evaluations that don't really say what they're looking for It's just preference" )
( henrySimon_00314 "We're going to do it in the only way we know how: that's the way that HTK does it in its simple HVite tool" )
( henrySimon_00315 "But intelligibility could also be impacted by   audible joins that disrupt the listener's perception" )
( henrySimon_00316 "We're going to have to use candidate units from mismatched non-identical linguistic contexts" )
( henrySimon_00317 "So the questions we're going to answer in the next module are: Can we judge how good a synthetic voice is in isolation? Or, is it only possible to do that by comparing to some other system that's better or worse than it?" )
( henrySimon_00318 "In general, in a big system, we might find hundreds or thousands for some of the more common unit types" )
( henrySimon_00319 "We're just going to assume that our target cost is of the most simple IFF type when designing our database" )
( henrySimon_00320 "That's a LOT of joins! We know that joins are the single biggest problem with unit selection speech synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00321 "We're going to come back to that when we talk about the database, and we can see where these pseudo-features come from" )
( henrySimon_00322 "So we'll pull all of the waveform fragments out that have been labelled, in this case, with the phoneme /@/" )
( henrySimon_00323 "It seems a reasonable hypothesis that it's   hard work listening to synthetic  speech compared to natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00324 "It will be then easy to make a comparison between that predicted F0 and the true F0 of a candidate" )
( henrySimon_00325 "If you implement an algorithm, you may or may not actually construct this list, because it's going to be huge" )
( henrySimon_00326 "To get a better understanding of the issues in text selection, let's work through a rather simplified example" )
( henrySimon_00327 "Nevertheless, the number of possible contexts is still very, very large and that's going to be a problem" )
( henrySimon_00328 "So we could improve that: we could put several frames around the join and measure the join cost across multiple frames" )
( henrySimon_00329 "Those were our ingredients for forced alignment: a language model, a pronunciation model and an acoustic model" )
( henrySimon_00330 "In other words, some of the linguistic environment has a very weak or negligible effect on the current sound" )
( henrySimon_00331 "The most perceptible artefact we get in unit selection synthesis is sometimes those concatenation points, or "joins"" )
( henrySimon_00332 "One would hope that making an improvement  anywhere in the system would lead to an   improvement in the synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00333 "For example, their fundamental frequency and their duration are strongly influenced by their position in the phrase" )
( henrySimon_00334 "We know that the beginning of the HMM aligns with the beginning of the audio, and the end of the HMM aligns with the end of the audio" )
( henrySimon_00335 "We'll do the same thing that we did for the letters: sort it,'uniq -c' it, and order it by frequency in reverse order" )
( henrySimon_00336 "We made two in the Blizzard Challenge, and  indeed, in all sorts of internal testing   we'll keep certain things under control" )
( henrySimon_00337 "We're similarly going to quantify the difference in the spectral envelope just before the join and just after the join" )
( henrySimon_00338 "Therefore, we're going to have to quantify how good each join is, and take that into account when choosing the sequence of candidates" )
( henrySimon_00339 "The join cost then makes sure that we only choose sequences of candidates that will concatenate smoothly and imperceptibly" )
( henrySimon_00340 "When we think we've got a pretty good system,   we might then go out and compare it somebody  else's system and hope that we're better" )
( henrySimon_00341 "Those interactions can actually  mean that improving something   early in the pipeline actually causes  problems later in the pipeline" )
( henrySimon_00342 "For the worked example, I'm going to actually just ignore linguistic context and try and get coverage just of diphones" )
( henrySimon_00343 "So we made a first order solution to that which was just to capture the co-articulation between adjacent phones in the speech signal" )
( henrySimon_00344 "What we should understand so far is that a unit selection speech synthesizer has the same front end as as any other synthesizer" )
( henrySimon_00345 "Before starting on that, you need to make sure you already know the following things: The first area of importance is a little bit of phonetics" )
( henrySimon_00346 "So there's still an advantage of a pipeline architecture made of modules that we understand that we can take apart and we can replace" )
( henrySimon_00347 "An obvious one there is: if text normalisation goes  wrong - the synthesiser says the wrong words   and the listener understands the wrong thing" )
( henrySimon_00348 "And here we can see that all the points along the scale are described and when they've done that, they submit their score and move on to the next sample" )
( henrySimon_00349 "Both of those are competing to affect F0, but this function just considers them independently, and just accumulates the penalties" )
( henrySimon_00350 "That's a reasonable criticism of them, but they will take us away from the ceiling effect and help us to differentiate between different systems" )
( henrySimon_00351 "This state here is going to contain a Gaussian or Gaussian mixture model that emits observations with an appropriate distribution for silence" )
( henrySimon_00352 "This is to make sure we have particularly good coverage in these smaller domains, so our voice will perform particularly well on these domains" )
( henrySimon_00353 "If we were to plot those numbers (and I'll let you do that for yourself, maybe in a spreadsheet) we'd see that has this Zipf-like decaying distribution" )
( henrySimon_00354 "Well, very simply by choosing candidates from an appropriate context - for example, phrase final - we'll get appropriate prosody automatically" )
( henrySimon_00355 "What makes unit selection synthesis feasible? The answer is that some (hopefully very many) linguistic contexts lead to about the same speech sound" )
( henrySimon_00356 "Let's examine each of those points in a little bit more detail and make them concrete with some examples of how they might appear to a listener by far and away" )
( henrySimon_00357 "You're going to find out that for yourself in the exercise! Because written text was not usually intended to be read aloud, its readability might be poor" )
( henrySimon_00358 "We're going to look at the match / mismatch between each candidate in turn and that target specification, and compute the target cost for each of them" )
( henrySimon_00359 "At each place is possibly used several different manners of making the sound and those are arranged on the vertical axis, not in any particular order" )
( henrySimon_00360 "It's the job of the target cost to measure similarity (or distance) between units in the database - which we call candidates - and the target specification" )
( henrySimon_00361 "We have better models, and so we could indeed today envisage predicting a complete acoustic specification - in fact, all the way to the waveform if you wanted" )
( henrySimon_00362 "If we miss here a word, how do we know we've misheard it? So I would never recommend the use of opinion scores or MUSHRA or anything like that to rate intelligibility" )
( henrySimon_00363 "Now, the context is potentially unbounded: it certainly spans the sentence in which we find the unit and we may even want to consider features beyond the sentence" )
( henrySimon_00364 "That's neat, because we can just run our algorithm and select a very large script and go into the studio and record for as long as (for example) we have money" )
( henrySimon_00365 "Whereas perhaps in a more complex sound, such as a liquid or a diphthong, with a complex and changing spectral envelope, it's more difficult to hide the joins in those sounds" )
( henrySimon_00366 "But this use off a single natural reference as gold standard is obviously flawed for the reason that we've already stated: there is more than one correct way of saying any sentence" )
( henrySimon_00367 "Now there's a whole lot of terminology flying  around testing, whether it's software testing   or whole system testing, whatever it might be,  we're not really going to get bogged down in it" )
( henrySimon_00368 "So to that extent that will correlate with listeners judgments very high cepstral distortion would suggest that they'll say they sound very different or if played only the synthetic sample" )
( henrySimon_00369 "We're going to look at a more sophisticated form of target cost now, where we predict some acoustic properties for the targets and compare those with actual acoustic properties of candidates" )
( henrySimon_00370 "We might also put a lower bound a bottom sample in that we know should always be worse than all of the systems that's known as the anchor, not obvious what that would be for synthetic speech, so it's not currently used" )
( henrySimon_00371 "We want maximum variation, so that our target cost function has a lot of candidates to choose amongst for each target position, and that our join cost function can find nice smooth joins between those candidates" )
( henrySimon_00372 "Using data where we just have a word transcription that's only aligned at the sentence level is so important and is the standard way of training an automatic speech recognition system, it comes with a special name" )
( henrySimon_00373 "Evaluation is obviously playing a critical role  in this because it's helping us to make the   decision that this was the best, and this was the  best, and that the route our research should take   should be like this, not some other path" )
( henrySimon_00374 "We're going to see that's a general trend   in evaluation: that we might be able to measure  something in the synthetic speech, but that thing   that we measure doesn't have a direct connection  back to only one property of the system" )
( henrySimon_00375 "The way I've just described that is in terms of linguistic features: effectively counting how many linguistic features (for example left phonetic context, or syllable stress, or position in phrase) match and how many mis-match" )
( henrySimon_00376 "The first feature is place and that's where in the mouth the sound is made and in particular with a consonant where some sort of constriction is formed and in the IPA chart those are arranged along the horizontal axis of this table" )
( henrySimon_00377 "Plotting those distributions of frequencies-of-types, from the most frequent to the least frequent (ordering them by their frequency of occurrence) and then plotting their frequency on this axis we always tend to get this sort of shape, this decaying curve" )
( henrySimon_00378 "The obvious ones are going to be the pitch (or the physical underlying property: fundamental frequency / F0), the energy - if speech suddenly gets louder or quieter we will notice that, if it's in an unnatural way - and, more generally, the overall spectral characteristics" )
( henrySimon_00379 "So what we're really looking for is not to cover every possible context (because that's impossible), it's to cover a wide variety of contexts so that the target cost and the join cost can between them choose units that don't mismatch too badly in linguistic features, and join together well" )
( henrySimon_00380 "The sort of things that you might include in your script design might be: choosing sentences that are easy to read out loud, so that your speaker can say them fluently without too many mistakes; you might want to cover low-frequency linguistic forms such as questions; you might want to boost the coverage of phrase-final and phrase-initial units, because in long sentences they're very rare; and you might want to include some domain-specific material, if you think your final system is going to be more frequently used in a particular domain (for example, reading out the news, or reading out emails, or something really simple like telling the time)" )
( henrySimon_00381 "But this is very uncommon these days" )
( henrySimon_00382 "But fine distinctions" )
( henrySimon_00383 "This is probably fine" )
( henrySimon_00384 "We could try modifying PESQ which has been done" )
( henrySimon_00385 "Unfortunately, that number's pretty meaningless" )
( henrySimon_00386 "And that's from the field of telecommunications" )
( henrySimon_00387 "We might put that onto a perceptual scale" )
( henrySimon_00388 "But once again, there are lots of valid natural contours" )
( henrySimon_00389 "We'll look at local differences" )
( henrySimon_00390 "Would this measure capture naturalness of unit selection speech" )
( henrySimon_00391 "They would say that sounds very unnatural" )
( henrySimon_00392 "And in the cepstral domain" )
( henrySimon_00393 "We'll do the same here" )
( henrySimon_00394 "This is just a spectrum with frequency here and magnitude" )
( henrySimon_00395 "We'll do some procedure of alignment" )
( henrySimon_00396 "So we'll extract some features" )
( henrySimon_00397 "It has peaks in the right places, for example" )
( henrySimon_00398 "That's just a sum of local differences" )
( henrySimon_00399 "So the method, as it stands, fails to account for natural variation" )
( henrySimon_00400 "It might be some other domain" )
( henrySimon_00401 "We can use relatively normal sentence" )
( henrySimon_00402 "We'll say gold again" )
( henrySimon_00403 "Now we will say cold again" )
( henrySimon_00404 "One might be more intelligible than the other" )
( henrySimon_00405 "But no individual human being ever hears the same sentence twice" )
( henrySimon_00406 "So we need to complete that" )
( henrySimon_00407 "But there are some constraints" )
( henrySimon_00408 "Here they're called subjects" )
( henrySimon_00409 "So five synthesisers" )
( henrySimon_00410 "One of them is obvious" )
( henrySimon_00411 "And other designs are possible" )
( henrySimon_00412 "Certainly they would take longer to do the test" )
( henrySimon_00413 "So here's a typical interface" )
( henrySimon_00414 "We need to worry about that" )
( henrySimon_00415 "They can't tell the difference between them" )
( henrySimon_00416 "It's not really good" )
( henrySimon_00417 "We call that the mean opinion score" )
( henrySimon_00418 "Maybe it doesn't matter" )
( henrySimon_00419 "That's pretty straightforward" )
( henrySimon_00420 "And that needs an interface" )
( henrySimon_00421 "That's possibly not true for things like naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00422 "Sometimes it described all the points" )
( henrySimon_00423 "Sometimes we just described the end points" )
( henrySimon_00424 "There's two main forms of evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00425 "We could do it at various  points: and you need to choose" )
( henrySimon_00426 "So I put that to one side" )
( henrySimon_00427 "You could do those in experiments for yourself" )
( henrySimon_00428 "They will be straightforward to measure" )
( henrySimon_00429 "That sometimes matters" )
( henrySimon_00430 "Rather, we use the term naturalness" )
( henrySimon_00431 "That's a common term in speech coding" )
( henrySimon_00432 "It's tempting to use the word "quality"" )
( henrySimon_00433 "We decided when to do it" )
( henrySimon_00434 "Nevertheless, we're always going  to try and improve systems" )
( henrySimon_00435 "Let's take some examples" )
( henrySimon_00436 "We're really not going to talk much about that" )
( henrySimon_00437 "We could go inside the code" )
( henrySimon_00438 "We have complete access to it" )
( henrySimon_00439 "Sometimes we see this term: "glass box"" )
( henrySimon_00440 "Like, we change the database" )
( henrySimon_00441 "We have to look at the waveforms (i" )
( henrySimon_00442 "For example, we might have a module  which does some normalisation" )
( henrySimon_00443 "So that's why we need to evaluate" )
( henrySimon_00444 "We pick the best of them" )
( henrySimon_00445 "I had again four ideas (it's a magic number!)" )
( henrySimon_00446 "I'll make my evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00447 "But why do we evaluate? Well, it's to make decisions" )
( henrySimon_00448 "We're going to design a task" )
( henrySimon_00449 "Our technique is an  improvement over some baseline" )
( henrySimon_00450 "We're going to be a little bit systematic" )
( henrySimon_00451 "Or they might not have joined very well" )
( henrySimon_00452 "So they have the wrong  co-articulation, for example" )
( henrySimon_00453 "And other things like prosody could be wrong" )
( henrySimon_00454 "Who those listeners might be" )
( henrySimon_00455 "How we present the stimuli to listeners" )
( henrySimon_00456 "There are many aspects of a system" )
( henrySimon_00457 "What we're going to do with the result of that" )
( henrySimon_00458 "We'll start right at the beginning" )
( henrySimon_00459 "In this module, we're going  to talk about evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00460 "We'll think about what are fair means to evaluate it" )
( henrySimon_00461 "Hopefully you're doing the exercise at the same time" )
( henrySimon_00462 "It's got timestamps" )
( henrySimon_00463 "and this with its full pronunciation" )
( henrySimon_00464 "maybe we say this with its full pronunciation" )
( henrySimon_00465 "we maybe reduce this vowel" )
( henrySimon_00466 "We might say "There" )
( henrySimon_00467 "On this network here, we just do token passing" )
( henrySimon_00468 "I'll omit the arrows (they all flow from left to right, of course)" )
( henrySimon_00469 "That's this model here" )
( henrySimon_00470 "Right, let's do some speech recognition!" )
( henrySimon_00471 "It's not obvious how to train this model, because we don't know where these optional silences are" )
( henrySimon_00472 "So we need to train this model" )
( henrySimon_00473 "They're models of digits" )
( henrySimon_00474 "It's called "flat start training"" )
( henrySimon_00475 "That's easy, in fact" )
( henrySimon_00476 "I've no idea how you would do that" )
( henrySimon_00477 "We've just got data" )
( henrySimon_00478 "That's not true" )
( henrySimon_00479 "That was the language model" )
( henrySimon_00480 "Let's write the simplest language model we can think of" )
( henrySimon_00481 "That's a very simple language model" )
( henrySimon_00482 "That doesn't need to be a full-blown N-gram" )
( henrySimon_00483 "And we need a language model" )
( henrySimon_00484 "They're going to be phone-sized models" )
( henrySimon_00485 "Do the readings to understand precisely what he means by that" )
( henrySimon_00486 "Joins are what listeners notice" )
( henrySimon_00487 "In other words, we'll make more joins than necessary" )
( henrySimon_00488 "We can call that the "canonical phone sequence"" )
( henrySimon_00489 "The front-end is not perfect" )
( henrySimon_00490 "We'll be down at this end of the continuum" )
( henrySimon_00491 "We'll start by looking at the time-aligned phonetic transcription" )
( henrySimon_00492 "That's because we'll get the high frequency ones along "for free" anyway" )
( henrySimon_00493 "and some other ones" )
( henrySimon_00494 "and various other diphones have gone" )
( henrySimon_00495 "So: these diphones" )
( henrySimon_00496 "So at the very least, we're going to control for length" )
( henrySimon_00497 "We won't write that out" )
( henrySimon_00498 "So we can get rid of these duplicates" )
( henrySimon_00499 "Again, in reality we might attach context to those" )
( henrySimon_00500 "I'm going to write down my wish list" )
( henrySimon_00501 "You might not actually store it in memory" )
( henrySimon_00502 "For example: they're not in our dictionary" )
( henrySimon_00503 "the prosodic variation might be limited" )
( henrySimon_00504 "For example" )
( henrySimon_00505 "It might be hard to read sentences from old novels out loud" )
( henrySimon_00506 "We won't consider these in any great depth here" )
( henrySimon_00507 "One is obvious: it will take time to record this thing" )
( henrySimon_00508 "There's a few good reasons for keeping the database size small" )
( henrySimon_00509 "Of course, real data doesn't exactly obey these distributions" )
( henrySimon_00510 "Let's run that" )
( henrySimon_00511 "Let's just make sure that bit of pattern works" )
( henrySimon_00512 "So let's 'grep'" )
( henrySimon_00513 "So again I'm going to be old-school: just do this directly on the command line" )
( henrySimon_00514 "We'll look at the distribution of speech sounds" )
( henrySimon_00515 "Let's do one more example" )
( henrySimon_00516 "Let's see if that works" )
( henrySimon_00517 "Let's check that bit of the pipeline works" )
( henrySimon_00518 "We'll see that those numbers have a Zipf-like distribution" )
( henrySimon_00519 "I'm going to plot the distribution of letter frequencies" )
( henrySimon_00520 "When I say "unit-in-context" I'm talking about the all the different diphones in all the different linguistic contexts" )
( henrySimon_00521 "I'm going to say "unit-in-context" for the remainder of this module" )
( henrySimon_00522 "So we should be talking about "base unit types in linguistic contexts"" )
( henrySimon_00523 "We've got "base unit types" such as diphones" )
( henrySimon_00524 "We'll probably stick to features that are within the sentence" )
( henrySimon_00525 "They're in sentences, typically" )
( henrySimon_00526 "So, from now on, let's just assume that our base unit type is the diphone" )
( henrySimon_00527 "Because the database is large, we might not want to do that by hand" )
( henrySimon_00528 "Here it's called a "sausage" but it's really a lattice" )
( henrySimon_00529 "We'd form them into a lattice" )
( henrySimon_00530 "Here it's something called Line Spectral Pairs" )
( henrySimon_00531 "Finally, we'll come full circle to this thing called "hybrid synthesis" which is probably best described as unit selection driven by a statistical model" )
( henrySimon_00532 "That's coming next" )
( henrySimon_00533 "It can be done very efficiently" )
( henrySimon_00534 "Those things aren't all easy to predict" )
( henrySimon_00535 "It doesn't matter to the search" )
( henrySimon_00536 "On some of those paths would be zero join costs" )
( henrySimon_00537 "That's really easy to implement" )
( henrySimon_00538 "Those might be actually much larger units" )
( henrySimon_00539 "But is suffering from extreme sparsity problems" )
( henrySimon_00540 "There's no problem with that" )
( henrySimon_00541 "We could have both sorts of features in a single target cost function" )
( henrySimon_00542 "We call that a "hybrid method"" )
( henrySimon_00543 "That's coming later in the course" )
( henrySimon_00544 "anything that you like" )
( henrySimon_00545 "How would we do that?" )
( henrySimon_00546 "We could go further" )
( henrySimon_00547 "We're going to give them some acoustic properties" )
( henrySimon_00548 "So far, we only know how to compare them in terms of linguistic features, which both have" )
( henrySimon_00549 "Again, just for the purpose of explanation, our units are phone-sized" )
( henrySimon_00550 "It doesn't really matter" )
( henrySimon_00551 "There is some ideal acoustic property of each target and so the same situation could hold" )
( henrySimon_00552 "This is completely possible" )
( henrySimon_00553 ") Yet it's possible that they sound very similar" )
( henrySimon_00554 "Yet, the candidate could be ideal for that position" )
( henrySimon_00555 "We compute join costs and perform a search" )
( henrySimon_00556 "It's just a weighted sum" )
( henrySimon_00557 "So we run that text processor" )
( henrySimon_00558 "That's the Acoustic Space Formulation" )
( henrySimon_00559 "We just get natural output" )
( henrySimon_00560 "That will get us prosody" )
( henrySimon_00561 "This is pretty much what Festival does" )
( henrySimon_00562 "Nevertheless, it will work" )
( henrySimon_00563 "So computation of this is going to be cheap" )
( henrySimon_00564 "There's no concept of a "near match"" )
( henrySimon_00565 "We have two available candidates" )
( henrySimon_00566 "Let's do candidate 1 first" )
( henrySimon_00567 "Don't worry about these for now" )
( henrySimon_00568 "For this candidate, we also know the same things" )
( henrySimon_00569 "So, let's make that completely clear" )
( henrySimon_00570 "We've already talked about that" )
( henrySimon_00571 "We'll look at how to design the ideal database" )
( henrySimon_00572 "At the moment we just know there is a database" )
( henrySimon_00573 "We now have a complete picture of unit selection" )
( henrySimon_00574 "It can do what's called "backing off"" )
( henrySimon_00575 "The search will decide" )
( henrySimon_00576 "Maybe this path" )
( henrySimon_00577 "So that might not be the best path through this lattice" )
( henrySimon_00578 "There it is" )
( henrySimon_00579 "That's what these red lines indicate" )
( henrySimon_00580 "This picture could simply be redrawn as follows" )
( henrySimon_00581 "You could build systems like that" )
( henrySimon_00582 "There's a lattice of paths" )
( henrySimon_00583 "That's easy" )
( henrySimon_00584 "They could be diphones" )
( henrySimon_00585 "Here they're whole phones" )
( henrySimon_00586 "Here's a homogeneous system" )
( henrySimon_00587 "Let's think more generally about that" )
( henrySimon_00588 "Generally we're going to get higher quality" )
( henrySimon_00589 "That's a great idea" )
( henrySimon_00590 "The joins are what our listener is most likely to notice" )
( henrySimon_00591 "We are better off using diphones" )
( henrySimon_00592 "They will propagate" )
( henrySimon_00593 "We could have drawn that path going from right to left" )
( henrySimon_00594 "So, through the join cost there's a kind of "domino effect"" )
( henrySimon_00595 "There's always a possibility of trying to make our cost functions better" )
( henrySimon_00596 "Those are not the same thing as perception" )
( henrySimon_00597 "Of course, these cost functions are not perfect" )
( henrySimon_00598 "That's a really simple join cost" )
( henrySimon_00599 "For example" )
( henrySimon_00600 "So we can quite easily splice those things together" )
( henrySimon_00601 "So, it'll be a weighted sum of mismatches" )
( henrySimon_00602 "Underlying all of this there's an assumption" )
( henrySimon_00603 "Why would a listener notice there's been a join in some speech?" )
( henrySimon_00604 "e" )
( henrySimon_00605 "We can see now that the choice of candidate in this position depends" )
( henrySimon_00606 "That measure of "sounding the same" involves an extra step of making some prediction of the acoustic properties of those target units" )
( henrySimon_00607 "We're trying to synthesize them" )
( henrySimon_00608 "One of them is what we've just described" )
( henrySimon_00609 "We're going to do that with a function" )
( henrySimon_00610 "We need to quantify it" )
( henrySimon_00611 "The motivation for that is pretty obvious" )
( henrySimon_00612 "We want to measure how well each of those will sound" )
( henrySimon_00613 "They do not yet have waveforms" )
( henrySimon_00614 "Let's do the next one" )
( henrySimon_00615 "That is going to make the diagram look a bit messy" )
( henrySimon_00616 "In reality we'll probably use diphones" )
( henrySimon_00617 "It's local" )
( henrySimon_00618 "A real system probably wouldn't do that" )
( henrySimon_00619 "In this example, my base unit type is the phoneme" )
( henrySimon_00620 "Neither do we quite know what the best unit size would be" )
( henrySimon_00621 "We will always find, from amongst those, one that's "good enough" at synthesis time" )
( henrySimon_00622 "What makes that possible?" )
( henrySimon_00623 "From this finite database we have to "make do"" )
( henrySimon_00624 "and so on" )
( henrySimon_00625 "The database size will double again" )
( henrySimon_00626 "But that's not enough" )
( henrySimon_00627 "The database size will double" )
( henrySimon_00628 "We'll see that later" )
( henrySimon_00629 "That's a problem" )
( henrySimon_00630 "It's not obvious what to modify there" )
( henrySimon_00631 "I'll just spell that out, so we are completely clear" )
( henrySimon_00632 "Let's state that clearly" )
( henrySimon_00633 "But it's not all bad news" )
( henrySimon_00634 "That sounds quite reasonable" )
( henrySimon_00635 "We can't quite do that with speech" )
( henrySimon_00636 "Obviously speech is produced in the human vocal tract" )
( henrySimon_00637 "We'll take them as a larger unit" )
( henrySimon_00638 "In fact, we won't even cut them up" )
( henrySimon_00639 "And so on" )
( henrySimon_00640 "those will synthesize the waveform" )
( henrySimon_00641 "So, for example" )
( henrySimon_00642 "Each of these candidates is just a little waveform fragment" )
( henrySimon_00643 "Here's a interactive example" )
( henrySimon_00644 "That will become clearer as we go through unit selection" )
( henrySimon_00645 "They're called formants" )
( henrySimon_00646 "This was covered in the course Speech Processing" )
( henrySimon_00647 "And that's called rounding" )
( henrySimon_00648 "That's voicing" )
( henrySimon_00649 "That's a plosive sound" )
( henrySimon_00650 "What do we need to know about phonetics?" )
( henrySimon_00651 "We're going to look at the entire system" )
( henrySimon_00652 "In this module we're going to cover unit selection" )
( henrySimon_00653 "We're not going to do any alignment or modifications to try and make it match what the speaker said" )
( henrySimon_00654 "More generally, we might think about how much   effort it is to listen to synthetic speech" )
( henrySimon_00655 "In other words, the sequence that is exactly what comes out of the front end" )
( henrySimon_00656 "Because we're just scaling things up, potentially linearly with the database size" )
( henrySimon_00657 "The only exception to that would be if we've made a mistake designing our database" )
( henrySimon_00658 "An Independent Feature Formulation target cost is really rather simple" )
( henrySimon_00659 "Now that's because these pipeline architectures are simply not invertable" )
( henrySimon_00660 "So, that's pretty much all there is to the Independent Feature Formulation" )
( henrySimon_00661 "And what we've talked about in this module on evaluation, all still applies" )
( henrySimon_00662 "I would only really, ever trust people typing in what they heard as a task" )
( henrySimon_00663 "For example there's a path here that essentially concatenates whole words" )
( henrySimon_00664 "That looks incredibly similar to dynamic time warping on the grid" )
( henrySimon_00665 "Well it's no different to building any other speech recognition system" )
( henrySimon_00666 "What we need is a function that assigns a score to each of these sentences" )
( henrySimon_00667 "That's going to be one of the main challenges in creating our database" )
( henrySimon_00668 "There's going to be a relatively small number of types of base unit" )
( henrySimon_00669 "It's possible of course for both of those things to happen at the same time" )
( henrySimon_00670 "It just is somewhat similar, and has the same sort of properties" )
( henrySimon_00671 "What's important is the effect that it has on the current speech sound" )
( henrySimon_00672 "We've already come across that problem when building the front end" )
( henrySimon_00673 "A more complicated system might use units of different types" )
( henrySimon_00674 "So for F0 we might have a pair of measures: Error and Correlation" )
( henrySimon_00675 "And the only way to do that is to have a lot of different listeners" )
( henrySimon_00676 "Let's see if we can understand what's going on in this diagram" )
( henrySimon_00677 "The method will work the same for diphones-in-context, of course" )
( henrySimon_00678 "I've got a directory full of label files of transcribed speech" )
( henrySimon_00679 "Therefore, to minimize the total cost, we need to conduct a search" )
( henrySimon_00680 "This unit lies on several possible paths coming from the left" )
( henrySimon_00681 "Here's a graphical representation of what the join cost is doing" )
( henrySimon_00682 "That's given us a linear string: a sequence of target units" )
( henrySimon_00683 "We'll also quite briefly mentioned  the idea of objective measures" )
( henrySimon_00684 "So there we now have each letter and the number of times it occurs" )
( henrySimon_00685 "Of course a weighted sum of mismatches is very cheap to compute" )
( henrySimon_00686 "Another good idea would be to write out the problem in half-phones" )
( henrySimon_00687 "Lots of sizes are possible: the diphone is the most obvious one" )
( henrySimon_00688 "For transmission down telephone systems we  talk took about the "quality" of the speech" )
( henrySimon_00689 "Then, given this set of observations, we could train the model of "one" and the same for all the other digits" )
( henrySimon_00690 "But think again: when we train whole word models such as in the "Build your own digit recognizer" exercise, those word models have many states and we did not need to align the states to the speech" )
( henrySimon_00691 "So it would take a very long time to cover these things in the tail" )
( henrySimon_00692 "In practice though, we can only record a fixed size database" )
( henrySimon_00693 "We'll write out our finite state pronunciation model of the word "can", add arcs, and optionally, instead of the full vowel, we could generate a reduced vowel" )
( henrySimon_00694 "After that we'll switch to looking for diphones-in-context" )
( henrySimon_00695 "We're just considering those two dimensions in this picture" )
( henrySimon_00696 "We can't really see how it's making this acoustic prediction" )
( henrySimon_00697 "But currently that's the best method for picking those weights" )
( henrySimon_00698 "That's going to include things like their phonetic context" )
( henrySimon_00699 "Why does it work? And perhaps what its limitations might be" )
( henrySimon_00700 "I know that these labels are always one or two characters long" )
