Hi everyone I'm doing a course on speech synthesis and for part of my project I'm implementing a greedy algorithm that tries to create an optimal ordering of a set of utterances such that for every new utterance in the list we get the maximum number of new diphones. thanks bye.

Next steps:

determine hypotheses, finalize methodology, run it, WRITE DOWN numbers and SAVE AND LABEL figures!!

specifically:
- reread the cmu arctic paper to see when they stop selecting (and other methodology decisions that we can use and then cite :)
- read over my own notes about script selection, check my notebook!!
- rewatch the script selection videos
- MAYBE read some of the other papers from that module, see what they're on about. lol.

NOTES:
- we have changed the end behavior to be 'either we have this many utterances or we got all of the diphones'
- another metric by which to compare methods could be counting how many utterances they need to get every diphone. or something

- WE CAN COMPARE PHONES HISTOGRAMS RATHER THAN DIPHONE HISTOGRAMS. THAT ROCKS. YAY!!!!
    - hey MULT script selection really shows off the differences in cost functions visually

next:
- maybe make a scoring function that doesn't normalize for length
    - probably a variant of the aware sPUa, and then we can compare the distributions of those two, ideally easy to see
        - best bit: we can secretly do that quick study last cuz we're like 99% sure of the outcome

- run these actual studies
    - i think we should hold onto as much of this data as possible, so we could graph it in R or do other data stuff to it
    - even just storing it all in a big text file

- SELECT. AN. ACTUAL. SCRIPT. HENRY. PLEASE.
    - I think the takeaway from the first study is that Aware is the best method, because it doesn't leave any diphones on the table
    - Then, it looks like proportional is best, which makes a lot of sense. Yay!
    - We can probably just go ahead and select with that straight away. Boo yah.
    - The CMU paper does two hand-pruning steps, one with visual inspection and one with literally trying to say the phrases and cutting the hard to say ones
        - We should do some version of this. I suppose. Cool. Science!!!

- DO NOT FORGET we also need test phrases in the script that we record on Thursday.
    - Lets make sure that some have jargon that we selected for, and that some don't
    - Side note-- the fact that we want to be able to select entire words when jargon occurs ABSOLUTELY motivates some tweaks to join/target cost
        - namely, we wanna make the join cost more important than the target cost, so that we select whole in-database words and phrases more frequently. YAY!!!!

- it's all coming together fr




NOTES BEING TAKEN DURING THE LITERAL SCRIPT SELECTION:
- Using 'aware' script selection algorithm and 'proportional' scoring
    - selecting 700 utterances, because that's about how many ARCTIC A has pre-prune.

- we now perform the manual pruning step, inspired by the ARCTIC paper
    - we do so by genuinely giving it a go reading out the utterances, and just straight up deleting the ones that I can't naturally read:
        - a: in one breath (too long)
        - b: in one take (too complex)
    - if an utterance is too long, but it includes a word that we consider to be domain-specific (i.e. HMM, Gaussian, Zipf, etc), we delete some of the utterance. In some cases
        - e.g. ( henrySimon_00301 "But if you go back to look at the material on token passing, you'll realize that we can ask the tokens to remember anything at all while they're passing through the HMM states, not just the ends of words" ) becomes "we can ask the tokens to remember anything at all while they're passing through the HMM states"
    - Hilariously (I think), one of the longest utterances that we had to remove from the data was "The sort of things that you might include in your script design might be: choosing sentences that are easy to read out loud, so that your speaker can say them fluently without too many mistakes; you might want to cover low-frequency linguistic forms such as questions; you might want to boost the coverage of phrase-final and phrase-initial units, because in long sentences they're very rare; and you might want to include some domain-specific material, if you think your final system is going to be more frequently used in a particular domain (for example, reading out the news, or reading out emails, or something really simple like telling the time)"
    - I also think that we can prune in real time, when we get into the studio. yk?

- HEY: AFTER THAT PRUNING, ID LIKE ONE FINAL PHONE AND/OR DIPHONE HISTOGRAM
    - and also, if we removed the only copy of any of the things, I wanna know about it
    - I actually would also love one of these for every single voice we build (if that's possible :)
