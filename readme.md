Hi everyone I'm doing a course on speech synthesis and for part of my project I'm implementing a greedy algorithm that tries to create an optimal ordering of a set of utterances such that for every new utterance in the list we get the maximum number of new diphones. thanks bye.

Next steps:

determine hypotheses, finalize methodology, run it, WRITE DOWN numbers and SAVE AND LABEL figures!!

specifically:
- reread the cmu arctic paper to see when they stop selecting (and other methodology decisions that we can use and then cite :)
- read over my own notes about script selection, check my notebook!!
- rewatch the script selection videos
- MAYBE read some of the other papers from that module, see what they're on about. lol.NOTES:
- we have changed the end behavior to be 'either we have this many utterances or we got all of the diphones'
- another metric by which to compare methods could be counting how many utterances they need to get every diphone. or something
