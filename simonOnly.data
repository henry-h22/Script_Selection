( henrySimon_00113 "We might have the noise that's always going to make the task harder" )
( henrySimon_00114 "It simply gets the candidates, and whatever acoustic properties they have, that's what the synthetic speech has" )
( henrySimon_00115 "I'm now going to count how often each letter occurs" )
( henrySimon_00116 "That is that they're distributed very unevenly" )
( henrySimon_00117 "Let's pursue the idea of diphones for a moment" )
( henrySimon_00118 "Now, even these simple descriptors  are probably not that simple" )
( henrySimon_00119 "What should we record? Before proceeding, let's do the usual check" )
( henrySimon_00120 "There's not a whole lot to do with perception in here" )
( henrySimon_00121 "So could even use minimal pairs" )
( henrySimon_00122 "We have an idea" )
( henrySimon_00123 "It might be during development" )
( henrySimon_00124 "That's not enough" )
( henrySimon_00125 "We would choose the best path through that" )
( henrySimon_00126 "Will a listener notice there's a join?" )

( henrySimon_00128 "Imagine then adding all possible linguistic features and enumerating a very long wish list in this way" )
( henrySimon_00129 "Things will also go wrong  when we generate the waveform" )
( henrySimon_00130 "We could try and mitigate that by having multiple natural examples" )
( henrySimon_00131 "The payoff is speed" )
( henrySimon_00132 "Maybe you could have a neural network" )
( henrySimon_00133 "Well, we have a choice" )
( henrySimon_00134 "You can find it on the website speech" )
( henrySimon_00136 "We'll think about what we're going   to ask our listeners to do" )
( henrySimon_00137 "And it needs to obtain their response" )
( henrySimon_00138 "So now on to how to do the evaluation" )
( henrySimon_00139 "and so on, all with weights accordingly" )
( henrySimon_00140 "How can we reduce the number of joins?" )
( henrySimon_00141 "The first choice is: what kind of unit you're going to use" )
( henrySimon_00142 "We can't push the errors back through them in the other direction" )
( henrySimon_00143 "Maybe MFCCs" )
( henrySimon_00144 "In other words, from a blank starting sheet without any prior information" )
( henrySimon_00145 "Let's spell that out" )
( henrySimon_00146 "We could keep doing that for all of the linguistic context factors that we think are important" )
( henrySimon_00147 "This 3-state silence model (we'll typically call it silence, or something like that)" )
( henrySimon_00148 "How should we record it? Do we need to be very careful about that?" )
( henrySimon_00149 "Imagine considering choosing this unit" )
( henrySimon_00150 "and you can imagine how many more there are" )
( henrySimon_00151 "This is now when we're not allowed to  look inside and see how things work" )
( henrySimon_00152 "So what can we do then?" )
( henrySimon_00153 "We also know F0 for all the candidates" )
( henrySimon_00155 "This model's just an HMM" )
( henrySimon_00156 "I'm not sure what it is, because it doesn't matter!" )
( henrySimon_00157 "Our text selection algorithm will have very likely provided us with a script in an order of decreasing richness" )
( henrySimon_00158 "Therefore the signal that we observe - the waveform - is a result of several interacting processes" )
( henrySimon_00159 "The exception to that would be an expert listener" )
( henrySimon_00160 "We're going to make a plan" )
( henrySimon_00161 "There's our distribution" )
( henrySimon_00162 "So there are some modified versions, and they do work to some limited extent" )
( henrySimon_00163 "So we can go off and fetch more from the database: we'll get all of them in fact" )
( henrySimon_00164 "I'm going to do that for all of my labelled speech files" )
( henrySimon_00165 "There's no guarantee of that" )
( henrySimon_00166 "Now, there might be two of our own systems,  like the four variants of my great ideas" )
( henrySimon_00167 "What motivates the method?" )
( henrySimon_00168 "That's already a schwa, so can't be reduced any further" )
( henrySimon_00169 "So, how open or closed is the vocal tract by the tongue?" )
( henrySimon_00170 "Again we see the same sort of pattern we saw with letters" )
( henrySimon_00171 "joining everything together" )
( henrySimon_00172 "We're going to attach all the information to the phoneme tier" )
( henrySimon_00173 "We'd like those sentences to be heard by a set of listeners" )
( henrySimon_00174 "So here they are, and their weights" )
( henrySimon_00175 "Now, precisely how we know that, we'll cover in the module on the database, a little bit later" )
( henrySimon_00176 "There's variants on it, but this is the official MUSHRA design" )
( henrySimon_00177 "What we now have then is a phonetic sequence with timestamps" )
( henrySimon_00178 "Now there's already a huge number of assumptions in doing that" )
( henrySimon_00179 "We just generalise that idea" )
( henrySimon_00180 "Then I'll repeat that procedure" )
( henrySimon_00181 "Yes, that's pulling out all of those" )
( henrySimon_00182 "As we've described it so far, unit selection concatenates small fragments of waveform" )
( henrySimon_00183 "That will fail to capture things like sudden changes of direction" )
( henrySimon_00184 "These are very much research tools" )
( henrySimon_00185 "All modern methods of speech synthesis - including unit selection that we've already covered - rely on a fairly substantial database of recorded natural speech" )
( henrySimon_00186 "We just need to predict sufficient properties to enable a comparison with candidate units" )
( henrySimon_00187 "Between words we always go through the short pause model, which can emit zero or more frames of silence" )
( henrySimon_00188 "The square is called a Latin square" )
( henrySimon_00189 "We compare it to our other ideas" )
( henrySimon_00190 "We don't want a single listener's responses to have an undue influence on the overall statistics" )
( henrySimon_00191 "But I ask only for comparisons" )
( henrySimon_00192 "For example, in this piece of source code,   we can see who wrote it, so there's a  high chance there might be a bug here" )
( henrySimon_00193 "On top of that phonetic labelling (or segmentation), we need to annotate the speech with all of the supra-segmental linguistic information: all the other things that the target cost might need to query" )
( henrySimon_00194 "That's an articulatory process" )
( henrySimon_00195 "And I'll take that idea forward and  the other ideas will stay on the shelf" )
( henrySimon_00196 "We're working with features that have already been produced by our front-end" )
( henrySimon_00197 "I'm using over a thousand sentences of transcribed speech here, and in those thousand sentences there are a couple of phonemes that occurred fewer than a hundred times, regardless of the context" )
( henrySimon_00198 "We have measured things about their pupils" )
( henrySimon_00199 "There's an example in the table of where a near match might be OK" )
( henrySimon_00200 "We're going to use Taylor's terminology here, to be consistent with his book" )
( henrySimon_00201 "As with most of the examples in this part of the course, I'm drawing my lattice in terms of whole phones because it's neater" )
( henrySimon_00202 "We can push things through them one direction" )
( henrySimon_00203 "We saw how the pronunciation model was simply the dictionary from our speech synthesizer with some rule-based vowel reduction" )
( henrySimon_00204 "In a real system, the length of these lists of candidates will be much, much longer" )
( henrySimon_00205 "I also know that they happen at the end of a line" )
( henrySimon_00206 "We need to know a lot more about this database" )
( henrySimon_00207 "Maybe there's a big F0 discontinuity" )
( henrySimon_00208 "Let's go right back to how speech is produced" )
( henrySimon_00209 "We'll explore all paths in parallel, this way" )
( henrySimon_00210 "We're going to use a simple greedy algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00211 "Unfortunately, if we enumerate all the possible contexts, they'll actually be pretty much infinite because context (theoretically at least) spans the entire sentence - possibly beyond" )
( henrySimon_00212 "It's got the special property that each number appears in every row and every column just once" )
( henrySimon_00213 "And then we look at the consistency across that to get a measure of how reliable our listening was" )
( henrySimon_00215 "Occasionally we might measure speaker similarity" )
( henrySimon_00216 "Unit selection errors might be that the units we  chose were from inappropriate contexts" )
( henrySimon_00217 "We might prefer to have much, much shorter tasks" )
( henrySimon_00219 "The states are these words, and we just join them up with arcs, with an end state and a start state" )
( henrySimon_00220 "This is about the simplest possible algorithm" )
( henrySimon_00221 "Now, you might be shouting out at this point that training the models on the same data we're aligning is cheating!" )
( henrySimon_00222 "Also, the sort of variation we get in it might be unlike what we normally get in spoken language" )
( henrySimon_00223 "They're in fact a part of international standards" )
( henrySimon_00224 "The optional short pause model at the word juncture" )
( henrySimon_00225 "There are a few types up here that are very frequent" )
( henrySimon_00226 "Let's do it with speech this time: transcribed speech" )
( henrySimon_00227 "Now I'd like to find out which of them was the best idea" )
( henrySimon_00228 "The canonical pronunciation or the vowel reduction" )
( henrySimon_00229 "We know that we keep coming across new words all the time" )
( henrySimon_00230 "If you don't like that one, pick any other model you like" )
( henrySimon_00231 "There's an advantage to being completely implicit" )
( henrySimon_00232 "That's actually rarely used these days, much more common" )
( henrySimon_00233 "For example, in the front end, things might go wrong very early in text normalisation, the wrong words are said" )
( henrySimon_00234 "And now we need to think, how are they going to do on this task" )
( henrySimon_00235 "I suggest doing it with words or with linguistic unit-types-in-context: perhaps something like triphones" )
( henrySimon_00236 "That's going to help get us out of a sparsity problem" )
( henrySimon_00237 "Let's summarize the key problems with diphone synthesis" )
( henrySimon_00238 "We would like them to each synthesize the same set of sentences" )
( henrySimon_00239 "We might actually go much smaller than that, and in online situations where we don't have control over the listeners, and they're listening situation where they're recruited via the Web" )
( henrySimon_00240 "We can describe the linguistic context of a sound: for example, the preceding phoneme + the following phoneme" )
( henrySimon_00241 "We're trying to guide the future development of the system" )
( henrySimon_00242 "We'll compile this model with the pronunciation model, which essentially means replacing each word with its sub-word units" )
( henrySimon_00243 "We could throw away sentences with very low frequency or polysyllabic words that we think our speaker will find difficult" )
( henrySimon_00244 "Coming back to this terminology, we'll  sometimes see this term: black box" )
( henrySimon_00245 "So each word could have its canonical pronunciation, like this" )
( henrySimon_00246 "It'll always give you the same sequence for the same input text" )
( henrySimon_00247 "Then we can combine the advantages of both types of sub-cost" )
( henrySimon_00248 "We're just going to sum up penalties for all of those mismatches" )
( henrySimon_00249 "That makes the calculation really simple, but it is a weakness" )
( henrySimon_00250 "So we would replace those targets with parameters: for example, F0 or some parameterization of the spectral envelope" )
( henrySimon_00251 "Nevertheless, it will still need the database to learn that model" )
( henrySimon_00252 "So there's an explosion (an exponential increase) in the number of types, just by taking one aspect of context into account" )
( henrySimon_00253 "Perhaps our front end didn't predict a pause in that situation" )
( henrySimon_00254 "However, there are attempts to take these measures, which are typically big combinations of many, many different features and modify them" )
( henrySimon_00255 "That relationship between Mel Cepstral Distortion and what listeners think isn't completely smooth" )
